        Toros y Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Ring and Museum), officially called
        the Plaza de Toros Monumental de Las Ventas.
Barrio de Salamanca is the most attractive
        and exclusive of these, and Gran Vía is the great turn-of-the-century
        avenue that  [ connects ]  east to west, old to new Madrid.
The small
        museum  [ houses ]  historic posters, capes, swords, paintings, and photos
        for aficionados of the corrida, and is perhaps best visited out of
        bullfighting season for those who want to get a glimpse of the interior
        of the ring.
A block  [ east ]  is the
        distinguished Museo Arqueológico (c/ Serrano, 13).
The museum’s
        archaeology collection addresses the art of ancient inhabitants of
        Spain,  [ with ]  statuettes and jewelry from 2nd-century b.c.
In the early 1990s, modernization projects, such as
        desperately needed air conditioning and humidity control, caused

In our maps the confluence point would have to lie  [ on ]  a clearing.
 [ At ]  the top the forest becomes lighter, we goe toward it and discover a clearing, grown mainly with large ferns, the confluence point is however still approx..
100 meters further  [ southwest ] .
The confluence point is now a few steps from here, and we move in a zigzag through the forest, the arrow  [ on ]  the GPS jumping again and again around.
I drove through this road section already several times, conscious that it is very near  [ to ]  the confluence point N 45° E 22° (for the first time in August 1999), however without knowing of the "Degree Confluence Project" - my friend Ulrich Leardi told me of it.

After crossing the border to Romania we took the road to Arad and reached the village Pecica,  [ where ]  we wanted to turn right in order to come to Sînpetru German.
We had difficulties to find the road, but a friendly old women went beside our car until the edge  [ of ]  the river Maros, which we had to cross.
Using field tracks we needed plenty of time to reach the village of Sînpetru German,  [ where ]  we met several very friendly women, who told us some interesting historical facts of their village.
On the way  [ to ]  Gelu, the next village, we had to drive over meadows and fields but fortunately there were some farmers we could ask for the right way, which was even harder to drive than the ways before.
After about 2 km we turned left on a field track  [ along ]  a high corn field.

There was a dragon snake that was so huge that it could drink from the creek while  [ coiling up ]  its tail to the tower.
As we walked into the oak wood the road changed into a path , which we left  [ at ]  about 300 m from the confluence because we were getting away from it.
We started descending a slope towards North-East-East and, after an hour of walking - from the monument - we reached our target, deep  [ into ]  the forest.
The GPS showed that we were  [ at ]  185 km from the confluence North 46 with East 27.
It lays  [ about ]  the western cliff of a 15 m deep ravine , on the bottom of which we saw a dry riverbed.

By nightfall we were back  [ in ]  Bucharest.
 [ In ]  this region fierce battles took place in the year 1917 (Marasti, Marasesti, Oituz) between the Romanian and Russian armies, on one side and the German and Austro-Hungarian ones, on the other.
Before starting our trek, we visited the impressing mausoleum  [ at ]  Marasti, at 20 km of Panciu.

We drove through the cities of Urziceni, Buzau, Ramnicu Sarat and, after three hours of driving and 200 km, we reached Focsani,  [ at ]  35 km from the confluence point, in the county of Vrancea

We continued our journey, heading west, towards Panciu.

The closest area of the road  [ to ]  the confluence ( 4.8 km ) is in the vicinity of the Ecaterina Teodoroiu monument (Romanian female hero of the First World War).
The closest area of the road to the confluence ( 4.8 km ) is  [ in ]  the vicinity of the Ecaterina Teodoroiu monument (Romanian female hero of the First World War).
Because a dirtroad started right at the monument ( [ on the right ]  coming from Panciu) and seemed to head exactly towards the target point (direction North-North-West), we left the car and continued our trip on foot on the Dealu Mare hill.
The point was very easy to access because the confluence point was only 35 m  [ next to ]  the street.....
In fact the city of Oradea is heated with thermal water, which is plenty  [ around ]  these parts, you just have to dig for it.
So, on this short holiday, we went to Oradea  [ where ]  part of my girlfriend’s family lives.
 [ At ]  the sign that says Baile 1 Mai (just half a mile after turning left from road 76/E79) we turned again left and entered the village of Rontau.

Next day we left for Bucharest and  [ on ]  the way we visited N47E23.
It is a big city (more than 220,000 population) that lies exactly  [ where ]  the hills end and the Pannonia Plains begin, on the river Crisul Repede (the Fast Cris), that crosses exactly the centre of the city.

We drove for another 2 or 3 km when the GPS showed the confluence directly up the hill, 500 m  [ further ] .
We left the car  [ under ]  some trees, for shade, and started climbing.
The climb was a pleasure: few trees, the terrain being mainly pasture,  [ with ]  lots of field flowers and a warming sun.
All  [ around ]  us we could see only forested heights, except for some houses from Bogdana and the farming fields around the village.
We were just 100 m away from the top of the hill, from  [ where ]  I could have taken pictures for a beautiful 360 degree panorama.
 [ On ]  the horizon the Meses Mountains can be seen.
For many miles  [ in that direction ]  there are no human settlements, only forests and hills.
 [ In front of ]  the near forest you can see a pole: that’s used for hay stacks, but now being spring the hay was recently exhausted.
This kind of poles were everywhere  [ on ]  those pastures (in fact poles like that can be seen on every pasture in Romania).

This is the point  [ where ]  the road to the confluence reaches the main road Ciucea – Romanasi.
If you look through the trees,  [ along ]  the dirt road, you can see that it climbs a slight slope.
 [ At ]  the end of the slope it’s the intersection.
If you come from Ciucea you turn right when you see that church  [ on your left ] .
In this picture notice also a small bridge,  [ over ]  the main river of the area, Agrij, that flows just between the houses.
Getting back to the paved road we decided not to go back to Ciucea but to go on to Romanasi,  [ where ]  we met Road 1F/E81.
The road was crossing the small mountains of Salaj County, a region  [ with ]  lots of mountains and hills, lying in the northern part of the Western Carpathians, where the mountains lose height and become hills.

But we decided to keep driving, and after some 20 km from Ciucea,  [ in ]  the village of Bogdana, we turned right, just near the main village church.
The confluence seemed to be  [ over ]  a hill.
 [ In ]  Ciucea, after visiting the Goga memorial house (a poet and former prime-minister from the beginning of the 20th century – worthy of a visit, takes less than an hour) we exited Road1/E60 and turned left to Romanasi.
We were just 100 m  [ away from ]  the top of the hill, from where I could have taken pictures for a beautiful 360 degree panorama.
At summer’s end farmers will again gather grass and pile it  [ around ]  that pole.
05-Oct-2001 -- The confluence is located between the villages of Fizeşu Gherlii and Sântioana some 500 meters from the road  [ on ]  a small hill.
We were now  [ at ]  almost 1.5 km from the confluence and had to find a way to get closer again.

I did go a little further up the valley and came across an explosives depot – I suppose It would not have been made welcome here a few years ago  [ in ]  my UK car!
The dry river valley was no longer dry – heavy recent rains  [ in ]  Romania have caused floods in several areas.

After a while there was a clearing  [ on ]  the east side of the valley and I decided to go up here.
In fact the point was  [ at ]  1020 metres – so a climb of almost 500 metres.
I stayed  [ in ]  deep forest as much as possible on the way to the valley bottom – slithering and sliding down the deep leaf litter.

The next visitor is welcome to my watch – it came off somewhere  [ on ]  the way down – if you go at 7.30 am maybe you will find it by hearing the alarm go off.
After the point I went to Sighişoara – home of Dracula  [ with ]  a fine medieval citadel.
I didn’t stay  [ at ]  the Dracula hotel or eat at the Dracula café but slept and ate very well despite the thunderstorm.

No time for more points this time – there are two unvisited  [ on ]  the Moldavian border and one more incomplete near the Danube delta.
Last Friday a colleague asked me if I was going away for the weekend – I said I had not planned anything – but it set me thinking and I quickly resolved to have a go at the nearest incomplete point to Kosovo – 570 km as the crow flies – 850 by via-Michelin –  [ in ]  Romania.
Fortunately Eastern Europe – even  [ outside ]  the EU is easy travelling for EU citizens and I was able to jump in the car (after printing some multimaps and a visit report or two (always the optimist) and drive across Serbia, and Bulgaria to Romania with few hassles (those there were concentrated on car insurance).
Leaving at 3.30 pm on Friday afternoon I covered 500 km on Fri eve and then after sleeping  [ in ]  the car I arrived near the confluence at around noon.
It wasn`t very easy to get there with our big rucksacks  [ on ]  the back.
23-Jul-2002 -- 47°N 26°E is located  [ in ]  the Ceahlău mountains near the village Izvoru Alb.
One of us waited  [ with ]  the car, the other one (me) went to take the pictures the confluence last 2-3 kilometers.

Luckily the confluence lies actually between and not  [ in ]  the middle of the fields.
I expected the point to be  [ in ]  reeds and swamps but the valley is all arable and it was easy to walk to the point.
 [ On ]  the way back I chatted to an elderly man – we had no common vocabulary but got on fine!
The worry with this point was whether there is any restricted zone  [ along ]  the border which would prevent a visit.
Some random observations – You might think Romania was already a member of the EU from the number of flags  [ on ]  official buildings – It soon will be in the EU but it is very different from Western Europe – To the “policeman” who demanded 150 Euro from me at the Bulgarian border at 3 a.m. for “not wearing a seat belt”, may you rot in hell – Pedestrians are 100% confident that cars will stop for them at crossings, not so in other countries – Romania has the “Roman” tradition of distance markers; every 100 metres a small one and every 1 km a proper post with distances and road number; splendid – Horse drawn carts are widespread still; they even have registration plates.

I talked with two climate modellers  [ at ]  INPA, Francis and Theotonio (shown on the right with their â€˜supercomputerâ€™), about how this deforestation would affect the rainforest, as cutting down a forest changes evaporation and thus rain patterns.
A week in Manaus
Tuesday, August 22nd, 2006

   I spent a week in Manaus, staying  [ in ]  the apartment of two graduate students and visiting Instituto National de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), a famous research center.
 [ In ]  the preserve, Alex maintains a large tower that measures CO2 concentrations, and is he trying to understand how CO2 fluxes into and out of the forest.
Alex let me climb to the top  [ of ]  the tower, where I was able to look across the treetops of a forest that stretches for thousands of miles beyond the horizon.

The Melting Spine of the Andes
Wednesday, January 17th, 2007
   Since Peru, I have followed the Andes  [ south ] , crossing the continental divide at least five times and gazing at peaks that stretch to 20,000 feet.
Quite likely, there will be a tag on [ on ] he fruit saying â€˜product of Chile.â€™

   Like California, during central Chileâ€™s summer, it does not rain, yet these orchards and vineyards have water because of snowmelt from the mountains.
Far up [ up ] n the valley, above 15,000 feet, you see snow and glaciers.
Far up in [ in ] he valley, above 15,000 feet, you see snow and glaciers.
Further do [ down ] you see a dry landscape with a river.
Even further do [ down ] you see highly productive agriculture.
While in S [ in ] tiago, I decided I wanted to climb into the mountains to see these glaciers and snow.
After visiting the local mountaineering club, I convinced Roberto to join me, and in two days, we hiked to the top of E [ of ] Plomo, a 17,800 ft peak overlooking Santiago.
After visiting the local mountaineering club, I convinced Roberto to join me, and in two days, we hiked to the top of El Plomo, a 17,800 ft peak over [ overlooking ] tiago.

From the top, we gazed on the tallest part of the Andes, incl [ including ] ncagua, South Americaâ€™s tallest mountain.
All these glaciers that you see in these photos are shrinking, and are all essential for the agriculture that I have biked by here in C [ in ] le.
The tallest of these peaks have been  [ covered ]  in snow and ice, and pictures that you see say more than I can about these experiences.
So much agriculture and so many people al [ along ] hese mountains rely on this snow pack to grow their crops and have drinking water.
So much of the land al [ along ] hese mountains is dry â€“ I went for a month, once, without seeing a single forest â€“ yet the people have water during the dry seasons because of snow and ice in the mountains.

An amazing number of people use bicycles  [ in ]  the small towns, and I enjoyed sitting in the town plazas and seeing few cars.

We celebrated Christmas biking  [ up ]  into the Andes, crossing into Chile.
Crossing a 15,500 ft pass (Paso Aguas Negras)  [ on ]  a road that sees less than 30 cars a day, we passed glaciers and snowfields in an experience that seemed more like mountaineering than bicycling.
Following the road 150 miles  [ down ]  the deep Elqui Valley, we arrived quickly to sea level and the beach town of La Serena, Chile.
Northern Argentina and crossing the Andes (again)
Friday, December 29th, 2006

   Biking south from Salta, green forest eventually gave away to desert landscape, and I again found myself biking long stretches  [ of ]  desert between small towns.

Mexico City and Bicycles
Wednesday, February 15th, 2006

   Following a route suggested by a local cyclist, I biked into the valley  [ where ]  Mexico City, the worldâ€™s third largest metropolitan area, sits in a cloud of smog, people, and cars.
The following day, I visited a sustainable-transportation organization  [ where ]  one of the cyclists I met works, and I watched a presentation on potential future bike lanes in the city.

   Following a route suggested by a local cyclist, I biked into the valley where Mexico City, the worldâ€™s third largest metropolitan area, sits  [ in ]  a cloud of smog, people, and cars.
The following day, I visited a sustainable-transportation organization where one of the cyclists I met works, and I watched a presentation on potential future bike lanes  [ in ]  the city.
When I pass a cyclist, I ask them why they ride, and why there arenâ€™t more cyclists  [ on ]  the roads, and if they have been in an accident.
Despite warnings of traffic and thieves, I stayed  [ in ]  the city over a week, enjoying the different colonial centers, parks, and people.
I ask you this: support bicycle lanes and other bike-friendly infrastructure  [ in ]  your town, even if you plan not to use it.
I also visited the National Institute of Ecology,  [ where ]  I talked to those working with the government to account for Mexico’s greenhouse gas emissions.
 [ At ]  the institute, I met with a woman who is in charge of categorizing the ‘co-benefits’ of reduced use of fossil fuels.
I spent my last three days  [ in ]  the city as a tourist.
Mexico City was built by the Spaniards  [ on top ]  of a seasonal lake and the ruins of the Aztec civilization.
Now the descendents of these civilizations walk the streets here  [ in ]  Mexico City, mixed with the descendents of the Spanish conquerors.
In my week  [ in ]  the city, I biked over 120 miles, stayed with three different people/families, managed to get in two major newspapers, visited a school (Logos middle school), and was interviewed by a local television station (which has subsequently flooded my inbox with emails from Mexicans excited about my trip).
In comparison to Los Angeles, I felt safer biking  [ in ]  Mexico City as the cars are smaller, they travel slower, and there are far more small alternative routes.
Entering the city during rush hour, I found I was the fastest vehicle on the road, happily following the makeshift â€˜bike laneâ€™ that appeared between the rows of cars stopped  [ at ]  a traffic light.
Bogota to Bucaramanga
Monday, June 26th, 2006
 
   After a week in Bogota, I departed the city, leaving  [ behind ]  what almost seems routine at this point – a group of new friends, a newspaper appearance, and a city that I hope to return to someday.
Camping  [ next to ]  families in the countryside, I am inevitably asked about money and about what life is like in the U.S.

Heading north, I camped  [ next to ]  the houses of a few more families, and followed long scenic valleys and canyons up and down until reaching the city of Bucaramanga, another of Colombia’s major cities.
I was escorted out of town by Bruce, an American who helped me out while  [ in ]  Bogota.
Heading northwest towards Venezuela (map), I first stopped  [ in ]  the colonial town of Zipaquira, where the locals have converted a salt mine into an underground cathedral.

This success combined with the generosity of all the people I met  [ along ]  the road leaves me feeling optimistic about what is possible.
Many people I have stayed with  [ on ]  this trip, especially in the countryside, live in small houses, are poor, own no car, and have little healthcare.

It will be a journey around the United States to promote solutions on global warming, and we will start  [ in ]  Boston, Massachusetts on April 21st.
Nearly 17 months ago I biked out my front door  [ in ]  California and started biking south.
Thank you again to everyone who was a part of this journey, from those of you I stayed  [ with ]  to those of you who simply sent a small email of support.
I hope I have given you a bit of a sense of what it is like to cross the Americas one village at a time, and made you feel a little bit connected to the many people who live  [ across ]  these continents.
Just a few days ago I arrived at the end of the road, as far south as I can bike  [ in ]  South America.
I now have personal connections with so many people  [ across ]  the two continents â€“ people whose houses I stayed in or camped next to.

Final Thoughts from Buenos Aires

   I write you from Buenos Aires,  [ where ]  I am preparing for the return home to the States.
I have taken a boat up the Amazon, crossed dirt roads over 15,000 ft Andean passes, luckily escaped bandits in southern Mexico, felt the wind and rain of Patagonia, and dodged buses in the capital cities  [ of ]  nearly every country.
I now speak very good Spanish, some Portuguese, and a few phrases in the native language of Quechua (useful in the mountains  [ of ]  Peru).
A school master that I talked to remarked that â€˜a few years ago, my friends would fly to Bogota instead of drive â€“ now they drive across the country.â€™ My first night out of Cartagena, I stayed  [ on ]  a farm with a man who had been kidnapped and held ransom for three days in 2000.
He said â€˜thanks to godâ€™ after saying that Uribe won, and then he told me that it would be safe for me to bike the main roads  [ in ]  Colombia.
The armed conflict here  [ in ]  Colombia is a complicated issue – if you have time, here is an article with more information.
I found a 5 dollar hotel, and spent a few days  [ in ]  town.
Cartagena is one of the oldest European cities  [ in ]  South America, founded in the 1530s.
The historic downtown is  [ surrounded ]  by city walls to keep out Caribbean pirates (the city was sacked numerous times), and the streets are barely wide enough for two horse carriages.
The city sits barely  [ above ]  sea level, and, like the islands of the Kuna Indians, I wondered what the future of the city will be when the ocean level rises.
For the first time this trip, I was  [ surrounded ]  by other travelers.
We sailed first to the San Blas Islands,  [ where ]  we anchored between two small islands.

A sail from Panama to Colombia
Saturday, May 27th, 2006
   As there are no roads between Panama and Colombia, I spent a few days  [ in ]  the city of Colon looking for a boat to Colombia.
All the islands sit less then a half meter  [ above ]  sea level, and we guessed how many years it would be before they were under water.

After two more days of sailing across the Caribbean, we arrived in Cartagena, Colombia, the first stop  [ in ]  South America.
Colon is a city  [ where ]  foreigners are regularly held at gun point in the daytime, and I left the marina only to give presentations at a local school as well as the rotary club.

(You can potentially get a free ride on a freighter, but only if you are willing to spent lots of time  [ in ]  Colon).
As I was staying  [ in ]  the marina (sleeping on different boats), I spent some time before departure helping sand the Golden Eagleâ€™s floors.

Copala to Durango – 4 days, 163 miles
Thursday, January 19th, 2006
   I spent two days in Copala, a picturesque town of about 1,500 people  [ in ]  the steep foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidente, a massive mountain range that hugs the west coast of Mexico.
The third night out, I stayed with the family of the doctor’s mother-in-law, who lived in the village of Llano Grande high  [ in ]  the mountains.
All employment  [ in ]  the village is based on harvesting wood from the forests.
Dinner was cooked on a wood stove, and I turned on and off the light  [ in ]  the extra room they had by unscrewing the bulb from the socket.
I am now  [ in ]  the city of Durango, staying for free at a hotel because I have befriended a man who runs an excellent bicycle touring company and has connections to the tourism industry.

I learned a few useful phrases in Quechua (â€˜I am 27 years oldâ€™, â€˜I come from the United Statesâ€™, â€˜I am hungryâ€™, â€˜you are prettyâ€™), and found these extremely useful in making friends  [ along ]  the road.
Everyone I stayed with seems to have enough to eat (and often share it with me), but, one man whose house I camped  [ next to ]  explained that there are people â€“ people who donâ€™t have land or who have mental problems â€“ along this road who simply donâ€™t have enough to eat.

Climbing  [ above ]  13,000 feet, I found the land was grazed by llamas and alpaca, and one night I even camped next to a flock of llamas (video and photo bottom left and center).
And then there were the 3 different families whose houses I camped  [ next to ] , and who all invited me and fed me in their kitchens.

Durango to San Luis Potosi – 6 days, 313 miles
Thursday, January 26th, 2006

   In the past week, I have cut across the high central plateau  [ of ]  Mexico.
But it is also clear that there are great benefits to being alone  [ on ]  the road.
According to a doctor I stayed with  [ in ]  the town of Fresnillo (met him on the street while asking directions to the firehouse), the area is the world’s second largest producer of silver.

I stayed an extra day  [ in ]  Zacatecas, talked with a school, and then camped atop a building in the center of town, where I encountered my first rain in Mexico.

The 1999 Floods in Venezuela
Tuesday, July 18th, 2006
   In 1999, it rained for half a month straight and Caracas and  [ surrounding ]  states were severely flooded.
It is estimated that 30,000 people died as flood waters swept away houses  [ along ]  rivers and landslides destroyed the houses built on hillsides.

We would climb the nearly 19,000 ft peak in just one morning, leaving our 14,000 ft base camp at midnight, hiking to the base  [ of ]  the glacier at 16,000 ft, and then using rope and crampons to reach the summit.
The morning we choose was perfect â€“ not a cloud  [ in ]  the sky, and, after hiking beneath the stars for hours, we watched the sunrise over the glaciated peaks.

Melting Glaciers and a Climb of Vallunaraju
Monday, October 2nd, 2006

   The city of Huaraz sits directly beneath the Cordillera Blanca, a massive mountain range that rises over 22,000 ft and  [ has ]  the worldâ€™s largest number of tropical glaciers.
Loosing these glaciers will cause major water problems  [ in ]  Peru, something that I will talk about in my next post.
It will also hurt the tourism industry  [ in ]  Huaraz as people visit these mountains to see the snow capped peaks.
 [ In ]  Huaraz, I met researchers at INRENA (Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturals), who monitor the glaciers.

In a few days  [ in ]  the mountains, I took the photos below of various glaciers â€“ in every case you can see the glaciers used to reach far below.

Guatemala to Placencia Belize – 6 days, 274 miles
Friday, March 17th, 2006
   After a night in a small Guatemalan village ( [ where ]  I ran into a high school friend), I crossed into Belize.
I also learned that cycling is a popular sport here, and I was also impressed with the number of bike racks  [ in ]  Belize City.
I met Dennis, a good friend from college,  [ at ]  the Belize City airport.
When he was deciding to join me, I promised we would bike short distances and spend lots of time  [ on ]  the beach.
Dennis and I biked one day to the capital of Belize, Belmopan, a town of 10,000 people,  [ where ]  we met with an organization helping Caribbean nations adapt to climate change.
The following day I gave a presentation  [ at ]  Galen University, a university that attempts to incorporate sustainable development into all of its classes.
Biking 10 miles down the road, we then spent the night  [ at ]  Jaguar Creek, an â€˜environmental peaceâ€™ center.
Stopping to camp for the night, we asked a retired American who moved to Belize if we could camp  [ on ]  his lawn.
I will try to put him  [ inside ] .â€™ Soon, a half-grown 11-month-old jaguar â€˜kittenâ€™ was diving into our stuff, and ran off with Dennisâ€™ biking glove.
His owner tried to put the jaguar  [ inside ] , but the kitten scratched the man and ran off, this time with Dennis’ bike helmet.
Recovering the helmet, Dennis and I decided it might be better to continue, and we camped  [ on ]  a lawn in Maya Center, a small town where the locals speak the language Maya Mopan.

We celebrated Christmas Eve and morning  [ on ]  a beach looking across Concepcion Bay, where we cooked dinner, shared biking stories, and then proceeded to teach me Mexican slang.

The climate  [ in ]  L.A. is perfect for year round bicycle commuting, yet few people bike because 1) everything is so spread out and 2) there are few (if any) bikeways or bike lanes.

Through Honduras to Nicaragua
Sunday, April 16th, 2006
   Leaving El Salvador, I climbed into the mountains  [ of ]  Honduras, continuing my winding route through Central America (see the map of my route).
After spending a day recovering  [ in ]  a hotel in the city of La Paz, I biked into Tegucigalpa, Honduras’ capital city.

As it was the week before Easter, everyone was on vacation, and most people were  [ at ]  the beach or the local swimming hole.
On Good Friday, I passed a family that demanded I join them  [ at ]  the local pool.
Returning to Honduras, I spent my first night camped outside of a family’s house  [ in ]  the countryside.
They invited me into their home, let me cook my dinner  [ on ]  their stove, and showed me pictures of past family events.
That night, I emerged from my tent many times, and one time left a pile of vomit  [ in ]  the lawn near the outhouse.
Across the Andes to Huaraz – Horse assisted bike touring

 [ At ]  higher altitude, I encountered more small towns, finding that here the locals speek the native language of Quechua.
After camping two nights  [ at ]  14,000 feet overlooking a huge glacier, I mounted my bike and crossed a 16,000 ft mountain pass, the highest in Peru.

Huaraz to Lima
Sunday, October 15th, 2006

   Leaving Huaraz, I climbed a 13,500 ft pass, camped one more night  [ in ]  the mountains, and then, in one day, descending to the coast (see map).
I stayed with Jose, a friend of a reporter that I stayed with while  [ in ]  Mexico City.
I also found that staying  [ at ]  the house of a newspaper editor is the best way to get in the news (nice article written by Jose on the right).
 [ In ]  Lima, I was busy.
I gave two school presentations, attended a conference on sustainable transportation, visited a team designing bike routes  [ for ]  Lima, met with people styding the effects of global warming in Peru, spent some time hanging out at the South American Explorer’s clubhouse, and also tried to be a tourist for two days, visiting museums.

Continuing south, I soon entered Lima, Peruâ€™s capital city and  [ where ]  9 million people, or one third of Peruâ€™s population, lives.
Entering large cities  [ in ]  Latin America gives me perhaps the largest rush I get on this trip â€“ probably because it is scary â€“ and I biked for two hours across the urban land, assisted by a few bike routes, before arriving where I would stay for a week.

The town  [ where ]  I learned to SCUBA dive, Placencia, was almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Iris in 1991.
Based on these stories, it seems that the human toll of Hurricane Mitch was many times worse than any storm  [ in ]  the U.S. Again, this is because of how people live here â€“ they have fewer resources to survive and recover from a storm.
 [ Down ]  the road from Placencia is Sand Bite, a small town that does not receive tourism dollars.
A recent study (here is a description) showed how an increase in the power of Atlantic hurricanes over the past 20 years is correlated with warmer ocean water  [ in ]  the Atlantic.
And, the people who will suffer the most will be the people who I have met here in Central America – people who live  [ in ]  poorly constructed houses, who live on vulnerable slopes, or who rely on the food they grow to live.

I found these men to be friendly, and I felt safe with them  [ on ]  the road.
I later learned that although it is generally safe to bike this area, it is â€˜paramilitary central,â€™ and one of my email contacts told me that a mass grave was recently found near one of the cities I stayed  [ in ] .
(The men in uniform  [ on ]  the road were from the army, not the paramilitaries â€“ read more about who the paramilitaries are here).
I was impressed that both  [ in ]  the lowlands and the highlands, the countryside is entirely cleared for cattle grazing.
Biking through the mountains, encountering occasional cold rain, the road eventually descended into the valley  [ where ]  the city of Medellin, Colombiaâ€™s second largest city, sits.
My advice was to bike in the daytime (which I do anyway), and stay only  [ in ]  the towns â€“ donâ€™t camp in the country side.

I stayed with a family,  [ at ]  two firestations, and a series of cheap hotels ($4 to $7 a night).
The route sees few foreigners, and nearly every person  [ on ]  the roadside asked me â€˜Â¿de donde viene?,â€™ or where do you come from.
They asked in a friendly manner, and I felt obliged to talk to each person (which can be tiring if you are  [ surrounded ]  by children â€“ see video center).
 [ In ]  the town of Caucasia, I befriended a man at the municipal building who then invited me to talk at the local school.

The military presence  [ along ]  these roads is impressive.
