asakusa is the heart of shitamachi , the quarter best-beloved of that fractious , gossipy , prodigal population called the edokko , who trace their “ downtown ” roots back at least three generations . edokko are suckers for sentimentality and for ninjo : the web of small favors and kindnesses that bind them together . sneeze in the middle of the night and your edokko neighbor will demand the next morning that you take better care of yourself ; stay home with a fever and she will be over by noon with a bowl of soup . an edokko craftsman would rather lose a commission than take any guff from a customer who does n’t know good work when he sees it . edokko quarrel in a language all their own , an earthy local dialect as profane and expressive as brooklynese . ignore the proprieties — or offend the pride of an edokko — and he will let you know about it , in no uncertain terms ; respect his sense of values and you make a friend for life . the heart of asakusa , in turn , is sensoji ( also known as the asakusa kannon temple ) . according to legend , the temple houses a small statue of the buddhist goddess of mercy , found in the sumida river by two local fishermen in the year 628 — but in fact not even the temple priests have ever seen it . when edo became the capital of the tokugawa shogunate , asakusa began to flourish as an entertainment quarter . in the early-19th century even the kabuki theaters were located here . the meiji restoration and the opening of japan to exotic new western-style amusements further enhanced asakusa ’s reputation as fun city . the first place in japan to call itself a “ bar ” opened in asakusa in 1880 ( and is still doing business ) ; the first movie theater opened here in 1903 . before long , the streets and alleys around the temple were filled with music halls , burlesque theaters , cabarets , gambling dens , and watering holes of every description . most of the temple quarter was firebombed to ashes in 1945 , but by 1958 the people of the area had raised enough money to rebuild sensoji and all of the important structures around it . so what if the restorations were in concrete ? the original is still there in spirit — and no visitor should neglect it . tokyo ’s best-known district is named after a silver mint originally located here . once the epitome of chic , ginza has lost many of its smartest young shoppers to the fashion boutiques of districts like aoyama and omote-sando , but the area is still fascinating . the windows of such department stores as wako and mitsukoshi are works of art . inside , there ’s more art : all the major department stores project themselves as bastions of culture , maintaining their own galleries and mounting frequent world-class exhibitions of prints , painting , pottery , and sculpture . downstairs you can find still more “ art ” — to western eyes at least — in the astonishing basement gourmet food displays . ( the basement is also a good place for cheaper snacks than you ’ll find in the street-level restaurants . ) running roughly north–south through ginza from the corner of hibiya park all the way to tokyo bay is the broad avenue called harumi-dori . taking a stroll down the avenue is such a national institution that there ’s even a colloquial expression for it : gin-bura . just south of ginza itself , as you walk toward the bay , you see on your left the red lanterns and long banners of the kabuki-za , home base for that most thrilling and colorful form of traditional japanese drama . the first kabuki theater was built in on this site in 1889 . designed to invoke the castle architecture of the tokugawa period , the theater was destroyed in an air raid in world war ii and rebuilt in 1951 . still farther south is the tsukiji central wholesale market — the largest fish market in asia . some 1,600 wholesale dealers do business here , supplying 90 percent of the fish consumed in tokyo every day . get here very early ( 5am is ideal ) to see the tuna auctions and enjoy the orchestrated pandemonium of the market at its finest . from here , you could walk to the lovely hama rikyu detached palace garden . originally a tokugawa family estate , the garden became a public park in 1945 . the path to the left as you enter leads to the ferry landing , where the “ river buses ” depart for their journeys up the sumida river to asakusa . bourbon madrid west of puerta del sol is the city ’s 18th-century expansion engineered by the bourbon monarchs . calle de alcalá merges with gran vía and leads to the plaza de la cibeles and the paseo del prado,with its trio of art museums . the area ’s spacious boulevards , grand plazas , and fountains are interspersed with densely populated 18th-century apartment buildings . after hitting the art world ’s big three , visitors can repair to retiro park , where kings once found respite from the demands of hectic city life . except for the traffic spitting out noise and air pollution , the ample plaza de la cibeles is splendid . the central fountain depicts cybele , a controversial greek fertility goddess , serenely settled in a chariot pulled by two lions . the sculptural ensemble is probably the best-known fountain in all spain . the most unavoidable building on the plaza is the cathedral-like palacio de comunicaciones , teasingly nicknamed nuestra señora de las comunicaciones ( our lady of communications ) . inaugurated in 1919 , the building is the quite remarkable central post office , with high ceilings and overhead walkways . also facing plaza de la cibeles , the banco de españa ( bank of spain ) headquarters combines neo-classical , baroque , and rococo styles . the financial district , madrid ’s wall street , begins here on calle de alcalá . imposing buildings in this high-rent district contain the head offices or branches of more than 100 banks , plus insurance companies , the finance ministry , and on nearby plaza de la lealtad , the bolsa de comercio ( stock e xchange ) . heading down leafy paseo del prado you ’ll find the first , and greatest , of the art museums here . highlights of the prado museum spanish : alongside modern master pablo picasso , diego velázquez y silva ( 1599–1660 ) is the most famous spanish painter who ever lived . he was hired by king felipe iv and became an amazingly perceptive court painter and , quite simply , the greatest spanish artist of the golden age . the royal family is featured in his seminal work , las meninas ( the maids of honor ) . the artist painted himself with palette in hand at the left side of his own masterpiece , in a sense part of the family , as he became in real life . another vast , unforgettable velázquez canvas here is surrender of breda , commemorating a spanish victory over dutch forces in 1625 . the chivalry of the winning general , the exhaustion of the loser , the less disguised emotions of their retinues , the array of upraised lances , and the burning landscape communicated a profound pathos . elsewhere are velázquez ’s portraits of the high and the mighty , along with studies of fun-loving , ordinary mortals . other great works include las hilanderas ( the spinners ) and los borrachos ( the drunkards ) . francisco de goya ( 1746–1828 ) , another court painter , had a tumultuous , wildly varied career , and excellent selections from nearly every phase of it are collected in the prado , which has the largest goya ensemble in the world . a philanderer in his youth , goya fled zaragoza in 1763 for the anonymity of madrid . he went on to become the king ’s principal artist . of all the prado ’s paintings , none is more discussed and disputed than la maja desnuda ( the naked maja ) , one of spain ’s first nudes . rumors of a scandalous affair between goya and the duchess of alba have long been assumed . goya ’s most celebrated royal portrait , the family of carlos iv , is daringly frank and unflattering ; only the royal children look remotely attractive . on still another level , the executions of the 3rd of may , one of history ’s most powerful protest pictures , depicts the shooting of spanish patriots in 1808 by the french . goya witnessed this tragedy of the war of independence from his cottage , then went to the scene by moonlight to sketch the victims . new goya rooms in the prado were opened in march 1999 . goya ’s harrowing “ black paintings , ” done when he was depressed and going deaf ( see saturn devouring one of his sons ) have been moved , temporarily , from the ground floor to the second floor . they will be a focal point of the prado ’s planned expansion . el greco ( 1541–1614 ) was born in crete and was long a resident in italy , but nonetheless became a consummate spanish painter . he worked in toledo , his adopted city , for 37 years , toiling away at the immense and intensely personal religious canvases that are his hallmark . asymmetrical compositions and a mystical mood of ecstasy typify his work . knight with his hand on chest , an early portrait , is realistic and alive , a study of a deep-eyed , bearded caballero ( gentleman ) in black . it is signed , in greek letters , “ domenikos theotokopoulos , ” the artist ’s real name . the prado is also well supplied with el greco ’s passionately colored religious paintings , such as adoration of the shepherds . felipe ii did n’t care for el greco ’s revolutionary style , and later critics wondered whether his elongated figures were the result of myopia , but his mystical masterpieces live on . francisco de zurbarán ( 1598–1664 ) , a member of the seville school , combined mysticism and realism and was a master of light . his greatest works are of mythological , religious and historic themes . his deeply religious monks , priests , and saints are painted in flowing robes with almost tangible textures . the prado owns his strained but fascinating battle picture , the defense of cádiz against the english , and the rarer still life of a goblet , two vases , and a pot emerging from a black background . bartolomé murillo ( 1617–1682 ) , spain ’s most popular religious artist of his time , depicted revered biblical personalities at ease . his tender scenes , as well as classical religious works with soaring angels , brought murillo international fame , although detractors label his later work mawkish and saccharine . josé ribera ( c . 1591–1652 ) spent much of his life in italy , where the valencia-born artist was known as lo spagnoletto ( the little spaniard ) . his portraits of saints , hermits , and martyrs reveal impeccable drawing skills , composition , and keen exploitation of light and shadow . dutch and flemish : hieronymus bosch ( c . 1450–1516 ) , whom the spanish call el bosco , has three masterpieces in the prado , including a large triptych called the garden of earthly delights . daringly mixing erotic fantasies and apocalyptic nightmares , it portrays the terrors and superstitions of the medieval peasant mind . bosch ’s wild hallucinations presage similar psychological explorations 400 years later by salvador dalí . peter paul rubens ( 1577–1640 ) , of noble ancestry , pursued a career as a diplomat as well as an artist . the prolific rubens is represented by dozens of paintings in the prado . of particular note is the huge adoration of the magi , a brilliant religious extravaganza , and the three graces , a portrait of fleshy nudes with an equally lush landscape . the blonde on the left is said to be rubens ’s second wife , helena . the greatest work of rogier van der weyden ( c . 1400 – 1464 ) , descent from the cross , an altarpiece , should not be missed . italian : titian ( c . 1490–1576 ) is represented by several paintings , one of the greatest of which is the portrait of the emperor carlos v. depicting titian ’s patron in armor , on horseback at the battle of mühlberg , it set the standard for court painters over the next century . titian also produced religious works , but seemed to have no difficulty changing gears to the downright lascivious : baccanal is about as far as an orgy can go within the bounds of a museum . the collection of paintings by raphael ( 1483–1520 ) in the prado was once kidnapped by napoleon and carted off to paris , though soon recovered . centuries of investigation have failed to uncover the identity of the cardinal , raphael ’s explosive character study of a subject with fishy eyes , aqualine nose , and cool , thin lips . tintoretto ( 1518–1594 ) brought mannerism to venice . look for his dramatic bible stories , originally ceiling paintings , and , on quite another plane , the close-up of a lady revealing her bosom . on your way through the italian rooms , be sure to keep an eye peeled for fra angelico ’s glowing and stupendous annunciation , as well as for antonello da messina ’s realistically detailed , intensely tragic christ sustained by an angel , and sandro botticelli ’s the story of nastagio degli onesti . a prado annex , the casón del buen retiro , up the hill in calle de felipe iv , houses a collection of 19th-century paintings , but remained closed for renovations in 2000 . across the paseo del prado is the museo thyssen-bor­nemizsa , a recent addition to madrid ’s already impressive art collections housed in the palacio de villahermosa . this elegant three-story brick palace has been specifically renovated to house one of the largest known private collections of ancient and modern paintings , the property of the german industrialist baron von thyssen-bornemizsa . more than 800 paintings are exhibited , dating from the 13th century to the present day . from the 19th and 20th centuries there are examples of trends such as the paris school , german expressionism , russian avant-garde , and american abstract painting . like a survey of western art , among the most important collections are classical works by fra angélico , van eyck , dürer , rembrandt , hals , titian , van dyck , and rubens , and impressionist works by manet , monet , renoir , gaugain , toulouse-lautrec , cézanne , and van gogh , among many others . an impressive private collection it certainly is , but there are those who have criticized it as an ostentatious collection of minor works by major artists . the third anchor in the golden art trio , a landmark of old madrid , is the hospital de san carlos ( c / santa i­sa­bel 52 ) , which now houses the centro de arte reina sofía . the museum focuses on spanish and international 20th- century art , and is best known for exhibiting pi­ca­sso ’s monumental ­guer­nica behind bulletproof glass . held in the museum of modern art in new york until the death of franco , per the artist ’s wishes , guernica , a panorama of horror provoked by the spanish civil war bombing of a defenseless basque town , is perhaps the 20th century ’s most famous painting . on display alongside are the original sketches and studies showing the work that went into the final canvas . the center also houses other paintings of pi­casso , as well as an opulent collection of works by miró , dalí , julio gonzález , and juan gris . directly across from the reina sofía is the atocha train station , an iron-and-glass affair with a small botanical garden inside . if you want to catch the high-speed ave train to córdoba and seville , or other trains to the south of spain , this is where you ’ll need to go . south­east of the train station is the real fábrica de ta­pi­ces ( royal tapestry factory , c / fuenterrabía , 2 ) . all that has changed since felipe v found­ed this workshop in 1721 is the method of dyeing the wool . the same 18th-century looms are still used , though the number of workers has dwindled considerably . goya worked here , creating the designs on which tapestries were based . they are still being copied , along with contemporary designs , on commission . immediately east of the museo del prado is the city ’s major green space , parque del buen retiro . until a little more than a century ago , retiro park was a royal preserve . today its lawns , gardens and promenades are the most convenient and enjoyable place for many madrileños to take a family outing ( see page 9 ) . in summer , kids and lovers rent rowboats and paddle about the small lake in the center of the park . the palacio de cristal ( crystal palace ) , a 19th-century iron and glass solarium that houses temporary art exhibitions , has finally reopened after years of renovations . another central breathing space , the real jardín botánico ( royal botanical garden ) , adjacent to the prado , was founded two centuries ago and is packed with enlightening displays of flowers and trees . at the northwest corner of retiro park is puerta de al­ca­lá , a monumental triumphal arch surmounted by warrior-angels , honoring carlos iii . until the late 19th century , this marked the eastern edge of madrid . now the plaza de la independencia , in which the arch stands , is a bedlam of midtown traffic and gateway to newer barrios east . modern madrid madrid ’s third major expansion took place in the 19th century , resulting in the foundations of modern madrid , a sprawling succession of residential neighborhoods , shops , cinemas , restaurants , banks and smaller museums . barrio de salamanca is the most attractive and exclusive of these , and gran vía is the great turn-of-the-century avenue that connects east to west , old to new madrid . paseo de recoletos is a continuation of paseo del prado that runs from plaza de la cibeles to plaza colón . a block east is the distinguished museo arqueológico ( c / serrano , 13 ) . the museum ’s archaeology collection addresses the art of ancient inhabitants of spain , with statuettes and jewelry from 2nd-century b.c . carthaginian settlers and miraculously preserved mosaics from 2nd-century a.d . roman spain . an unforgettable item is la dama de elche ( the lady of elche ) , a stone sculpture found in alicante province in 1897 . this thoroughly noble goddess , with beautiful cheekbones , lips , and eyes , and wearing a fanciful headdress , may be 2,500 years old . on the museum grounds — or , more correctly , under the ground — is a careful reproduction of the painted scenes discovered in a cave in altamira in northern spain : prehistoric depictions of animals , dating back 15,000 years and representing man ’s first illustrations of the world around him . they are said to be some of the finest prehistoric cave drawings ever discovered . plaza de colón is a large open space that has been the recent scene of far-reaching public-works projects . the city airport bus terminal operates below ground , beneath an 1885 statue of christopher columbus and a monument to the discovery of the new world . there is also the centro cultural de la villa ( city cultural center ) , with facilities for concerts , theatre , art exhibitions , and films . paseo de la castellana is madrid ’s principal north-south avenue , running for several miles through the heart of the city and bordering the salamanca district to its west . in the area north of plaza de colón , you come to a newer section of town , where patrician townhouses in the central area give way to luxurious modern apartment blocks with landscaped balconies . museo lázaro galdiano ( c / serrano , 122 ) is an astonishingly wide-ranging and priceless private collection . featured here are ancient jewelry , including a celtic diadem from the 2nd century b.c . , medieval and renaissance masterpieces in ivory and enamel , gold and silver , rare church vestments , and medieval weapons . its paintings comprise a rembrandt portrait of saskia van uylenburgh , dated the year they were married ; hieronymus bosch at his most diabolical ; a rich repository of goya official portraits , colorful sketches of real life , and haunting scenes of witches and horrors ; el greco ’s sensitive st. francis of assisi and an early ( 1562 ) picture from his venetian period ; and the english painters reynolds , gainsborough , and constable . but the museum ’s greatest pride , spotlighted in its own niche on the ground floor , is a portrait of angelic beauty , painted around 1480 by leonardo da vinci , entitled the saviour . another smaller but equally interesting museum is the museo sorolla ( paseo del general martínez campos , 37 ) . the only madrid museum devoted to a single painter , this mansion was the hom e and studio of joaquín sorolla ( 1863–1923 ) . it has close to 300 paintings on view , showing the valencian impressionist ’s favorite seaside scenes and landscapes . the house has a charming lived-in feel . quite a way east of the salamanca barrio is the plaza de toros y museo taurino ( bullfighting ring and museum ) , officially called the plaza de toros monumental de las ventas . this is where to go to see an authentic bullfight , a seemingly anachronistic pursuit that continues to inspire the passions of so many madrileños . the small museum houses historic posters , capes , swords , paintings , and photos for aficionados of the corrida , and is perhaps best visited out of bullfighting season for those who want to get a glimpse of the interior of the ring . museo del prado madrid ’s pride , the prado museum , is indisputably the world ’s greatest collection of spanish paintings and one of the world ’s most prestigious museums . even apart from its spanish treasures , it deserves high priority on any visitor ’s agenda for its hundreds of famous foreign works , especially of the italian and flemish schools . this immense hoard of art works , ranging from the 12th to the 19th century , was collected and donated by spain ’s hapsburg and bourbon kings , private patrons of the arts , and convents and monasteries around the country . despite its greatness , the museum came about somewhat by chance . more than two centuries ago , carlos iii commissioned the architect juan de villanueva , draftsman of the royal palace , to design this neo-classical building . it was to have serv­ed as a museum of natural history , but after some eventful delays ( napoleon ’s invasion badly damaged the building ) , its mission was diverted to art , and the royal museum of painting was inaugurated in 1819 . in 1868 it became el mu­seo del prado . in the early 1990s , modernization projects , such as desperately needed air conditioning and humidity control , caused upheaval in the museum . although these are now completed , further renovation and work on an extension are underway . the famed spanish architect rafael moneo , a pritzker prize winner , is set to begin the prado ’s long-awaited expansion so that more of its vast collection can be exhibited . the prado owns perhaps 10,000 paintings , but at present can only display about 10 percent of them ( the overflow is either in storage or on loan to museums around the world . ) seeing and appreciating even that many great paintings could occupy a serious student of art for many weeks . short-term visitors may have to settle for the condensed highlights , perhaps in a hectic couple of hours . to take in more old masters per mile , it ’s vital to plan ahead . decide what you want to see and head for it first , even if it demands that you rush past obvious masterworks . given the usual crowds , you ’d be wise to rest your feet from time to time , or seek refreshment in the basement restaurant . near the puerta del sol puerta del sol ( gateway to the sun ) is madrid ’s busiest plaza and for centuries has been the commercial hub of the city . today it marks the transition between hapsburg madrid and the city expansion of the bourbon kings . the original gate that once existed here — part of the ancient town wall — was torn down in 1570 . ten streets converge on the plaza , and all the radial highways of spain are measured from puerta del sol , designated “ kilometer zero ” ( on the sidewalk on the south side of the square is a symbol of this distinction ) . the no-nonsense , neo-classical building on the south side of the square ( casa de correos ) houses the main offices of the regional government . thousands of madrileños gather here for a ritual every new year ’s eve . they try to swallow a dozen grapes while the clock atop the building strikes 12 , after which pandemonium breaks out . facing all the bustle of a remodeled puerta del sol is a statue based on madrid ’s coat of arms , which depicts a bear leaning against a madroño tree ( an arbutus , or strawberry tree ) . the bear is a symbol of madrid , while the tío pepe sign , an advertisement for one of spain ’s most famous brands of sherry , has become the unofficial symbol of the puerta del sol . just north of the puerta del sol and next door to the ministry of finance , is the real academia de bellas artes de san fernando — call it the museum of the royal academy . it possesses a celebrated collection of goya ’s paintings , including burial of the sardine , and a superb self-portrait of the artist in his old age . velázquez , murillo , and rubens are also represented among the hundreds of works on display . the royal academy also has a magnificent collection of paintings by zurbarán , rivaling that of the prado museum . representative of the artist ’s austere , devotional style is vision of the blessed alonso rodríguez . southeast of puerta del sol is plaza santa ana and the huertas district , both of which are chock full of restaurants , tascas and tapas bars , theaters , and live music and flamenco clubs . the area really springs to life at night . 09-aug-2003 -- on saturday , 9th august 2003 , daniel and i start with our enduros approx . 100 kilometers from the confluence point . in the preceding years i travelled some thousand offroad kilometers in romania and therefore we take the most beautiful enduro paths to the confluence point , naturally there is also something new to discover . the last kilometers before we take the forest road , which leads approximately toward the confluence point , we are driving on the street , because it goes steeply uphill from the valley and is is rather hard to drive in the forest . i drove through this road section already several times , conscious that it is very near to the confluence point n 45° e 22° ( for the first time in august 1999 ) , however without knowing of the " degree confluence project " - my friend ulrich leardi told me of it . we bend off on the forest road , which is partly freshly graded . in the top there are even completely new branches toward to the confluence point because of the present timber work ! we try to drive near on the wood-cutting tracks as close as possible , and after approx . 2 hours of travel we got the motorcycles to within 530 meters of the confluence point . we cross a light hardwood forest and a deeply cut brook bed . in our maps the confluence point would have to lie on a clearing . at the top the forest becomes lighter , we goe toward it and discover a clearing , grown mainly with large ferns , the confluence point is however still approx . . 100 meters further southwest . we dive again into the hardwood forest and cross a further , deeply cut brook bed . the confluence point is now a few steps from here , and we move in a zigzag through the forest , the arrow on the gps jumping again and again around . after several attempts , however , we always land in the same place : here is the confluence point ! we take a few pictures , unfortunately without the hoped-for view and take a small rest . then we take the way back through the wonderful landscape , having afterwards a very interesting enduro week with many beautiful offroad kilometers . romania has very much nature to offer , the hospitality of the people is terrific - this country is always worth a journey ! 15-aug-2003 -- on 15-august-2003 our journey to three confluence-points led us on the e 70 from the point south of craiova to strehaia , where we took the road to targu jiu . the roads are in really good condition . according to many boards beside the streets this is the result of a co-operation with the european union . in the village ciuperceni we took the direction to godinesti and followed finally we followed the sign to paraul de vale . the way through the village , where we were accompanied by children , geese , chickens , cows , sheep etc. had the correct direction . but soon the tar cover ended and it was more and more difficult to drive . we continued driving , because it seemed to be too hot to walk the last 3000 m . finally our mitsubishi stuck and we had much trouble to make it free again . so we had to park the car about 700 m far from n45e23 at the edge of a forest . but now we were lucky . it was rather hilly , nevertheless we were in the forehilles of the southern carpates , but the forest was not hard to cross and its shade was refreshing . we found n45e23 on a clearing with view on grass-covered hills . horses feasted nearby and we enjoyed the beautiful prospect in the shade of shrubs – after having taken the photos , of course . after the very careful return trip down to paraul de vale we turned via godinesti to baia de arama and baile herculane . this travel gave wonderful views into the carpates . beautiful waterfalls , ravines , rocks , wild brooks and passport heights could be seen and we ended this wonderful day with two successfully visited confluences and the impressions of two completely different landscapes in caransebes , where we started home to tuttlingen ( germany ) the next day . 23-aug-2002 -- on 23-august-2002 at 8 am we left makó ( hungary ) . after crossing the border to romania we took the road to arad and reached the village pecica , where we wanted to turn right in order to come to sînpetru german . we had difficulties to find the road , but a friendly old women went beside our car until the edge of the river maros , which we had to cross . to our surprise there was no bridge , but an old wooden ferry ( better to say : a float ) . it really was an adventure . using field tracks we needed plenty of time to reach the village of sînpetru german , where we met several very friendly women , who told us some interesting historical facts of their village . on the way to gelu , the next village , we had to drive over meadows and fields but fortunately there were some farmers we could ask for the right way , which was even harder to drive than the ways before . finally we reached the street from gelu to sînnicolau mare . after about 2 km we turned left on a field track along a high corn field . we left our car on 46 n , 150 m away from the point . carefully we followed the gps and wanted to take the photos . but the batteries of the camera were to low and we had to change it in the field . interrupting that action , an unexpected farmer called loudly in our direction . we had to drive away our car immediately . after his tractor had passed , we wanted to return to the point , but a " man with bike " tried to prevent us from doing so . our explanations were unsuccessful , so we had to wait a long time , until he was out of sight . now we returned to the point , took the photos and headed on to 46 n 22 e. 23-aug-2002 -- leaving 46n 21e we drove via arad and lipova to the village zăbalţ where a little pig tried to follow us . about 5 km behind that village in the direction to bata we turned right near 21 e into a way leading into a forest . but soon we were stopped by a bar . so we had to walk the rest of the way , accompanied by thousands of mosquitoes . 1.3 km far from the confluence we must leave the way turning left , because it was the wrong direction . the walk through thicket , wood and stinging nettles , sometimes interrupted by small clearings was an hard effort , but the mosquitoes did n't allow us to stop for a moment . we reached the point after about half an hour . when we tried to take the photos a big hornet joined to the mosquitoes . so we did n't want to spend some more time there . the gps led us back to the way , where our car was standing and we were happy , having been the first visitors of two confluences at one day . but a 3,5 hour wait at the romanian/hungarian border prohibited having a shower before 1:30 am . 23-mar-2002 -- on march 23rd , a rainy and cloudy weather , the team ( mara iliescu , dana iliescu , ramona demean , marius iliescu , mihai tiepac and lucky ) drove from sibiu to deva . reaching simeria we 've done right till uroi . we passed through hărău and certeju de jos arriving in the village hondol . along the valley hondol at the right side we found an abandoned mine and at only 50 meters we parked the car . the gps ' said ' that from here till the point we had 200 meters left ( point ) . our trip continued on foot crossing the valley and climbing the hill which was covered by a young and dense forest . when we reached the point it started snowing . altitude 575 meters . distance from simeria 17.1 km . 19-apr-2012 -- because the weather was fine and we still had some time , we drove to this point after the visit of 46n 25e . the route did n't take an end , and the streets often were very bad . in contrast the villages and the landscape were very impressing . the last three km of the way went on a very small road , rather a bad field path , passing a newly built monastry to the buildings near the crossing . we only had to go 200 metres across a humid meadow until the edge of the field . we drove on a bigger road to sibiu , in german : hermannstadt , a nice little town with pleasant flair . 19-apr-2012 -- the conditions of our further trip allowed it to make an excursion into the upstate of romania and to visit this confluence point at this opportunity . partially , the roads were very shabby and it seemed not only because of the last winter . we could park our car appr . 950 m away from the point and could make a comfortable walk to the mountain ridge . there is a herdsmen station not far from the point , but only the dogs came to visit us . because we had good weather and still a bit time we decided to drive on small roads to the west to point 46n 24e . 26-dec-2002 -- this confluence can be found 1,5 km to the west from icafalâu ( ikafalva ) in covasna county , romania . it is interesting to know , that this county was the easternmost corner of hungary until the end of the wwi . the ancient name of the county is háromszék and ikafalva ( icafalău ) is one of its oldest villages . the county is part of transylvania , and is mainly inhabited by székely people ( hungarian people living in eastern transylvania ) – they speak hungarian up to the present days . today this land is 300 km far from the hungarian state border , deeply in the heart of romania . we have spent the christmas time at judit ’s parents in sfântu gheorghe ( sepsiszentgyörgy ) , capital of covasna . we had white christmas there and 15-20 degree celsius below zero . on 26th of december the four of us - me , my wife judit , her father apja and her friend andrea - went for discovering this confluence in the bodok mountains , only 23 km apart from sepsiszentgyörgy . the sun was shining and the snow was crunching in the numbing cold . perfect time for the conquest . we drove to the ne on the 11 main road and turned nw at cernat ( csernáton ) . from this point we had to drive through the village and than towards north on a narrow mountain road , where the horse-sleigh is so far the most popular winter vehicle . we parked the car in a small field where we could turn . this was only 250 meters from the confluence ! after a short discussion and a few cups of hot tea we walked towards the target that seemed to be located on the hill . this area is a valley of a small creek . after a short tracking we realized that there was no path up to the peak except for some animal trails . we chose the shortest way to the top in the deep snow . after about one hundred meters of elevation we got to the top of the saddle , very close to the intersection of 46°n and 26°e . the confluence lies in the middle of the forest . fortunately we had good satellite signal because of the winter . i have an old garmin but i got an accurate position . ( picture # 5 ) it is 725 meter above sea level . i took photos to the four winds ( picture # 1-4 ) and from the team also . ( picture # 7 ) there was only 1 pm ( local time ) so we had some time left to discover an interesting ruin of ikavár ( ika castle ) . the castle is 1 km to sw on the other side of the valley , on the top of a 30m high crag . according to a legend , the ika castle was built by giants . there was a dragon snake that was so huge that it could drink from the creek while coiling up its tail to the tower . according to the székely chronicle , the castle was built by ika , son of sándor rabonbán . the conquest of 46°n 26°e was a nice christmas gift for us and remains a lovely memory . 04-sep-2004 -- we began our expedition on saturday , september 4th , 2004 . at 11 o'clock we left bucharest for focsani on dn 2 ( european road 85 ) . the gps showed that we were at 185 km from the confluence north 46 with east 27 . we drove through the cities of urziceni , buzau , ramnicu sarat and , after three hours of driving and 200 km , we reached focsani , at 35 km from the confluence point , in the county of vrancea we continued our journey , heading west , towards panciu . passing through the villages of muncelu and straoane , the distance to confluence point decreased to almost 5 km . the closest area of the road to the confluence ( 4.8 km ) is in the vicinity of the ecaterina teodoroiu monument ( romanian female hero of the first world war ) . because a dirtroad started right at the monument ( on the right coming from panciu ) and seemed to head exactly towards the target point ( direction north-north-west ) , we left the car and continued our trip on foot on the dealu mare hill . luckily , this cart road kept us on the right heading , passing through the villagers ' pastures , cornfields and vineyards . after about 3 km , we entered the forest , and at a crossroad ( 1 km from the confluence ) we took the road which kept us going towards north-east . as we walked into the oak wood the road changed into a path , which we left at about 300 m from the confluence because we were getting away from it . we were surprised to meet a deer , which wandered away quickly as it saw us . we started descending a slope towards north-east-east and , after an hour of walking - from the monument - we reached our target , deep into the forest . needless to say that , because of the treetop cover , we had poor satellite coverage , but we managed to locate the confluence with a 10-15 m error , after some wandering around . it lays about the western cliff of a 15 m deep ravine , on the bottom of which we saw a dry riverbed . the steep slope and the thick carpet of fallen leaves hindered the descent and very precise determination of the confluence point , but we managed to pinpoint and take photos within sufficient accuracy from ' zero point ' . we congratulated ourselves and made the necessary photos to immortalize for eternity our conquest . the return journey was easy , because we knew already the area . by nightfall we were back in bucharest . in this region fierce battles took place in the year 1917 ( marasti , marasesti , oituz ) between the romanian and russian armies , on one side and the german and austro-hungarian ones , on the other . before starting our trek , we visited the impressing mausoleum at marasti , at 20 km of panciu . 28-mar-2004 -- we started our trip in galaţi , it takes around 1.5 h from our hotel to the confluence point . the point was very easy to access because the confluence point was only 35 m next to the street . . . . . 07-may-2002 -- english on our way home from oradea ( see n47e22 ) we made a detour for n47e23 . in ciucea , after visiting the goga memorial house ( a poet and former prime-minister from the beginning of the 20th century – worthy of a visit , takes less than an hour ) we exited road1/e60 and turned left to romanasi . the road was crossing the small mountains of salaj county , a region with lots of mountains and hills , lying in the northern part of the western carpathians , where the mountains lose height and become hills . we crossed many villages , but the confluence approached by a very small rate : while we were driving one kilometer the confluence approached by half a kilometer . at some point we thought that we had taken perhaps not the best road to get near the spot . but we decided to keep driving , and after some 20 km from ciucea , in the village of bogdana , we turned right , just near the main village church . the confluence seemed to be over a hill . so we drove along a small river that took us just by that hill . after exiting bogdana the road is so bad that an off-road vehicle is a must . we drove for another 2 or 3 km when the gps showed the confluence directly up the hill , 500 m further . we left the car under some trees , for shade , and started climbing . the climb was a pleasure : few trees , the terrain being mainly pasture , with lots of field flowers and a warming sun . no animals or humans at all . just the sound of insects and birds . all around us we could see only forested heights , except for some houses from bogdana and the farming fields around the village . we reached the spot in about 10 minutes . the elevation was 536 m . we were just 100 m away from the top of the hill , from where i could have taken pictures for a beautiful 360 degree panorama . pic # 1 is a 180 degree panorama , the left side showing the view northwards , towards bogdana ( which cannot be seen because of the hill ) . on the horizon the meses mountains can be seen . the center of the panorama shows the way we climbed to the confluence . pic # 2 is taken southwards . for many miles in that direction there are no human settlements , only forests and hills . pic # 3 is taken northwards . pic # 4 shows the way we climbed to the spot . in front of the near forest you can see a pole : that ’s used for hay stacks , but now being spring the hay was recently exhausted . at summer ’s end farmers will again gather grass and pile it around that pole . this kind of poles were everywhere on those pastures ( in fact poles like that can be seen on every pasture in romania ) . pic # 5 : the position ( all zeros again ) . pic # 6 is taken on our way back to the main road : you can see the condition of the road that we used to approach the confluence , some houses in bogdana and some horses , right on the road . pic # 7 shows the main church of bogdana . this is the point where the road to the confluence reaches the main road ciucea – romanasi . if you look through the trees , along the dirt road , you can see that it climbs a slight slope . at the end of the slope it ’s the intersection . if you come from ciucea you turn right when you see that church on your left . in this picture notice also a small bridge , over the main river of the area , agrij , that flows just between the houses . getting back to the paved road we decided not to go back to ciucea but to go on to romanasi , where we met road 1f/e81 . we had only 70 more km to cluj ( the next important city on our way back to bucharest ) taking this way , while if getting back to ciucea and on to cluj the normal way would have been now about 25 km longer . so it was a pretty long detour but worthy , as we mapped the 13th romanian confluence . 05-oct-2001 -- the confluence is located between the villages of fizeşu gherlii and sântioana some 500 meters from the road on a small hill . at first it seemd quite easy to reach the point from the road , but after 100 meters we discovered a small river hidden by trees and of course no bridge . after 30 minutes we found a road that crossed the river , but which did not lead to the confluence . we were now at almost 1.5 km from the confluence and had to find a way to get closer again . we managed to find a very bad road , full of tractor trails and went by car till we were aproximately 800 m away from the point . after that it was a short , but steep walk uphill . photo 1 is looking north , photo 2 west , photo 3 south and photo 4 east . the gps is in photo 5 , ioana in photo 6 and myself in photo 7 . 23-jul-2005 -- well a new job and a new country – or place anyway – kosovo has an uncertain international status . also an uncertain power supply as i write this by candle light . last friday a colleague asked me if i was going away for the weekend – i said i had not planned anything – but it set me thinking and i quickly resolved to have a go at the nearest incomplete point to kosovo – 570 km as the crow flies – 850 by via-michelin – in romania . fortunately eastern europe – even outside the eu is easy travelling for eu citizens and i was able to jump in the car ( after printing some multimaps and a visit report or two ( always the optimist ) and drive across serbia , and bulgaria to romania with few hassles ( those there were concentrated on car insurance ) . leaving at 3.30 pm on friday afternoon i covered 500 km on fri eve and then after sleeping in the car i arrived near the confluence at around noon . the instructions from the previous visitors were quite correct and it was easy to find the suggested start point . i did go a little further up the valley and came across an explosives depot – i suppose it would not have been made welcome here a few years ago in my uk car ! as previously described the track gives up after a while and then there is no alternative but to follow the valley up . the dry river valley was no longer dry – heavy recent rains in romania have caused floods in several areas . i tried to avoid walking in the stream but the choice was tall nettles and brambles . it soon became clear that this point was not going to be taken easily and maybe the first visitors made a wise choice not going up . adam macer suggested a machete - good idea . the valley is deep with steep sides and my gps would only pick up 3 satellites – they were in a nice straight line and it would not give me a fix . after a while there was a clearing on the east side of the valley and i decided to go up here . it was very hard going – steep and overgrown . at least it allowed the gps to pick up more satellites and confirm my position . after a further 30 minutes of climbing i eventually reached the point . 2 hours for 1.8km and 500 metres ascent is slow going ! there was no need to go out of the main valley and the point was some distance from the ridge line - i did not go on up to the ridge to see the rain from a different angle ! the start altitude was 550 metres and the estimated height for the point on the web site was 875 metres . in fact the point was at 1020 metres – so a climb of almost 500 metres . the return – as always – was much quicker ; one hour only to the car . i stayed in deep forest as much as possible on the way to the valley bottom – slithering and sliding down the deep leaf litter . once at the stream i abandoned all pretence at dry feet and splashed merrily down the stream – in the rain . i was soaked and had very scratched and stung arms and legs but satisfied with the point – stupid is n’t it ! near the bottom i saw a black and yellow salamander trying to squeeze itself under a stone . the next visitor is welcome to my watch – it came off somewhere on the way down – if you go at 7.30 am maybe you will find it by hearing the alarm go off . anyway only a cheap casio ! after the point i went to sighişoara – home of dracula with a fine medieval citadel . i did n’t stay at the dracula hotel or eat at the dracula café but slept and ate very well despite the thunderstorm . no time for more points this time – there are two unvisited on the moldavian border and one more incomplete near the danube delta . another time . that reminds me – i have not seen the points of molvania “ a land untouched by modern dentistry ” on the confluence project web site , i hope this strange omission will be rectified so that point baggers there can report on their achievements . 23-jul-2002 -- 47°n 26°e is located in the ceahlău mountains near the village izvoru alb . in the 3rd day of our trekking-tour through ceahlău we visited the confluence at 16:12 o'clock . only thick forest , nothing to see , only trees . it wasn`t very easy to get there with our big rucksacks on the back . 12-aug-2004 -- we visited this confluence on our way home from 48n 28e . we took the bus from chisinau ( moldova ) to roman , the town 10 kilometers from the confluence . we got ourselves a lift to burueneşti , a small village just three kilometers from the confluence . one of us waited with the car , the other one ( me ) went to take the pictures the confluence last 2-3 kilometers . i literally had to run , because the car would wait only short time . burueneşti lies at the river siret , and the confluence on a plateau northeast of it . when reached the top of the slope and caught a first glimpse of the plateau i was a bit disappointed : again nothing but large cornfields . luckily the confluence lies actually between and not in the middle of the fields . near the spot local villagers were guarding their cows . 21-aug-2005 -- continued from 45n 29e - the second point is further north – away from the danube delta and very close to the moldovan border . the worry with this point was whether there is any restricted zone along the border which would prevent a visit . driving away from tulcea , i crossed the danube for the 3rd of 4 times in 2 days . this time it was a ferry . very prompt and well organised . soon after disembarking and heading north for galaţi it started to rain . this area suffered from severe floods in july and there is still water lying in the fields and gardens and dead crops remain , forlorn in the fields . the rain became torrential and it was only just possible to keep driving for more than half an hour . eventually i got away from it and quite soon was driving on dry roads again . galaţi is not an attractive place – ugly apartment blocks and chemical factories . it is not helped by floods and torrential rain . i was glad to be away . moving further north you pass through rich farmland and then rolling hills . i decided to camp as close to the point as possible so that i could make an early start and drive home on the sunday . as i drove through the villages there were many people walking to the nearest village for the saturday night dance . i camped near the hamlet of sălăgeni – just a few metres from the border . no sign of the border or any security . i was woken up by the sun at dawn – 6.30 a.m. there were already old men taking cattle out to the fields to graze . the scene reminded me of the german television programme " heimat " . the programme traces a german village through 80 years of the 20th century . sălăgeni reminded me of the first episode set in about 1918 – tranquil but with few comforts . horses are more common than cars and ducks , hens and turkeys wander around . the point itself was 1 km from the village . i forded two drainage ditches – one waist high . i am sure i could have gone round but why not go direct ! i expected the point to be in reeds and swamps but the valley is all arable and it was easy to walk to the point . romania is now complete ! on the way back i chatted to an elderly man – we had no common vocabulary but got on fine ! no time for messing about – long drive home so i changed and set off . some random observations – you might think romania was already a member of the eu from the number of flags on official buildings – it soon will be in the eu but it is very different from western europe – to the “ policeman ” who demanded 150 euro from me at the bulgarian border at 3 a.m. for “ not wearing a seat belt ” , may you rot in hell – pedestrians are 100 % confident that cars will stop for them at crossings , not so in other countries – romania has the “ roman ” tradition of distance markers ; every 100 metres a small one and every 1 km a proper post with distances and road number ; splendid – horse drawn carts are widespread still ; they even have registration plates . drum bun is written on many signs ; it means “ have a good journey ” . the future of the amazon ? a week in manaus tuesday , august 22nd , 2006 i spent a week in manaus , staying in the apartment of two graduate students and visiting instituto national de pesquisas da amazonia ( inpa ) , a famous research center . here , in addition to giving a presentation for inpa and also for students at a neighboring university , i talked with scientists modelling climate in the amazon rainforest . from what i gather , the rainforest faces three major threats . 1 ) direct deforestation , 2 ) decreased rainfall caused by deforestation , and 3 ) the possibility that global warming will dry out the basin . although the amazon basin is enormous ( similar in size to the contiguous u.s. ) , deforestation is a major threat . everywhere roads are built , the forest is cut down , making way for fields of soy beans or beef cattle . from one of the researchers at inpa , i received the images below which show the forest in 1992 , deforestation by 2002 , and then projected deforestation in 2033 ( deforestation shown in red ) . i talked with two climate modellers at inpa , francis and theotonio ( shown on the right with their â€˜supercomputerâ€™ ) , about how this deforestation would affect the rainforest , as cutting down a forest changes evaporation and thus rain patterns . if the entire forest were cut down , they estimate that rainfall would decrease on average 30 % , with many areas becoming too dry for forest . indeed , one study suggests that there are two stable states of the amazon â € “ one state like the rainforest we find today , and another state where much of the forest is dry savannah . if too much forest is cut down , there is a possibility that it would push much of the amazon into the drier state , unable to easily return to forest . ( more on this here . ) these studies , however , do not consider the effects of global warming . to be sure , the effects of global warming are uncertain because large scale climate models are not good at modelling rainfall in the tropics . nonetheless , a few models ( not all ) suggest that a warmer earth means a much drier amazon , which would turn much of the basin into savannah . this may be wrong . it may also be correct . decreasing rain and savannahization are real risks to the rainforest . due to uncertainty in the science–we ca nâ€™t be sure if deforestation or global warming will reduce rain–it is difficult to put percentages on these risks , and theotonio and francis , while claiming it a real possibility , balked at guessing its probability . nonetheless , if it is true , the results are very bad . a loss of the amazon would not only loose countless species , but also release incredible amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , accelerating global warming . do we really want to find out if it is true or not ? my last full day in manaus , i travelled with alexender , one of my hosts , to a large forest preserve near the city . in the preserve , alex maintains a large tower that measures co2 concentrations , and is he trying to understand how co2 fluxes into and out of the forest . alex let me climb to the top of the tower , where i was able to look across the treetops of a forest that stretches for thousands of miles beyond the horizon . listening to the birds , monkeys , and insects , it was hard not to be both awed by the amazon and to wonder what its future will be . the melting spine of the andes wednesday , january 17th , 2007 since peru , i have followed the andes south , crossing the continental divide at least five times and gazing at peaks that stretch to 20,000 feet . the tallest of these peaks have been covered in snow and ice , and pictures that you see say more than i can about these experiences . i have written about this before , but passing through chile has made the point even more clear . so much agriculture and so many people along these mountains rely on this snow pack to grow their crops and have drinking water . so much of the land along these mountains is dry â € “ i went for a month , once , without seeing a single forest â € “ yet the people have water during the dry seasons because of snow and ice in the mountains . ( see a scientific article about how this is a problem worldwide , and not just along the andes ) . chile has a climate very similar to california , and , like california , chile grows an amazing variety of fruits and nuts . next time you are in the supermarket in the winter ( if you live in the northern hemisphere ) take a look to see where the fruits come from . quite likely , there will be a tag on the fruit saying â€˜product of chile.â€™ like california , during central chile â€™s summer , it does not rain , yet these orchards and vineyards have water because of snowmelt from the mountains . below you can see photos from where i entered chile most recently , via the valley de elqui , one of chile â€™s most productive regions for vineyards . far up in the valley , above 15,000 feet , you see snow and glaciers . further down , you see a dry landscape with a river . even further down , you see highly productive agriculture . while in santiago , i decided i wanted to climb into the mountains to see these glaciers and snow . after visiting the local mountaineering club , i convinced roberto to join me , and in two days , we hiked to the top of el plomo , a 17,800 ft peak overlooking santiago . from the top , we gazed on the tallest part of the andes , including aconcagua , south america â€™s tallest mountain . all these glaciers that you see in these photos are shrinking , and are all essential for the agriculture that i have biked by here in chile . northern argentina and crossing the andes ( again ) friday , december 29th , 2006 biking south from salta , green forest eventually gave away to desert landscape , and i again found myself biking long stretches of desert between small towns . biking argentina ( and chile ) after traveling the northern countries of south america is a bit of a shock . the people here are far wealthier . stores are stocked with all the food i could want ( i get to drink my daily liter of chocolate milk in argentina , for instance ) . people also treat me more like an equal and stare at me less when i bike into a plaza . northern argentina is also relaxed . they have a siesta that lasts from 12:30 to almost six in the afternoon . more than once i biked into a town at 4pm and wanted to buy some food , and i was told ” not at this hour ! you have to wait until the store opens at 5:30 or 6 . ” it is hot in the afternoon ( it is summer here ) , so i suppose this is somewhat understandable . an amazing number of people use bicycles in the small towns , and i enjoyed sitting in the town plazas and seeing few cars . ( click on video below right to see bikes ) . my friend dave johnson flew in to join me for this section ( and brought the new bike fork â € “ see last entry ) . we celebrated christmas biking up into the andes , crossing into chile . santa brought us a dirt road , a steep climb , and a fierce headwind that made us travel half as fast . ( watch the ‘ official ride for climate christmas video ’ by clicking on the video on the right ) . crossing a 15,500 ft pass ( paso aguas negras ) on a road that sees less than 30 cars a day , we passed glaciers and snowfields in an experience that seemed more like mountaineering than bicycling . following the road 150 miles down the deep elqui valley , we arrived quickly to sea level and the beach town of la serena , chile . mexico city and bicycles wednesday , february 15th , 2006 following a route suggested by a local cyclist , i biked into the valley where mexico city , the world â€™s third largest metropolitan area , sits in a cloud of smog , people , and cars . despite warnings of traffic and thieves , i stayed in the city over a week , enjoying the different colonial centers , parks , and people . mexico city is huge , with both shacks and multimillionaire homes crawling up the sides of the valley . in my week in the city , i biked over 120 miles , stayed with three different people/families , managed to get in two major newspapers , visited a school ( logos middle school ) , and was interviewed by a local television station ( which has subsequently flooded my inbox with emails from mexicans excited about my trip ) . in comparison to los angeles , i felt safer biking in mexico city as the cars are smaller , they travel slower , and there are far more small alternative routes . entering the city during rush hour , i found i was the fastest vehicle on the road , happily following the makeshift â€˜bike laneâ€™ that appeared between the rows of cars stopped at a traffic light . it was a sweet type of revenge , and i enjoyed , perhaps too much , weaving in and around the multiple green buses and taxis . to be sure , it was exhausting . a map big enough to cover the city required a 200-page book , and i frequently stopped to extract it from my pannier in attempts to find alternate routes . the pollution stung my lungs and eyes the first day , but i seemed to adapt afterwards . joining forces with the local bike activists , i rode wednesday night with the bicitekas , a group advocating expanded bike rights within the city . starting at 9:30pm , a team of almost 100 cyclists took over two lanes of traffic and rode through the city until 1am . watch the two videos on the left to get a sense of the ride . the following day , i visited a sustainable-transportation organization where one of the cyclists i met works , and i watched a presentation on potential future bike lanes in the city . to be sure , some people do use bicycles in the city . i have a running survey going . when i pass a cyclist , i ask them why they ride , and why there are nâ€™t more cyclists on the roads , and if they have been in an accident . most say they ride because it is faster for short distances , and that others do nâ€™t ride because they are scared , do nâ€™t think of it , or are just plain lazy . most also say they have gotten in some type of accident with a car . other people , like one man biking and carrying a ladder , replied , â€˜ca nâ€™t you see i â€™m trying to work right now?â€™ and kept cycling . while biking around town , i did meet one man promoting a naked bike ride in june . i â€™m not sure how this will help the cause . bicycles are not for everyone , but they are for more people than currently use them . we are supposed to get some form of exercise every day . what if we used this exercise for part of our daily errand running ? biking to town or walking to the store ? not only would we use far less gasoline , but we would be healthier , and we would actually have more time , as we would be combining exercise and commuting . americans are far overweight , and mexicans are following us . i ask you this : support bicycle lanes and other bike-friendly infrastructure in your town , even if you plan not to use it . ( you can read a scientific paper showing how much better off we would be here ) . i also visited the national institute of ecology , where i talked to those working with the government to account for mexico ’s greenhouse gas emissions . mexico , unlike the u.s. , has signed the kyoto protocal , but does not yet have to reduce emissions because it is a poorer country . at the institute , i met with a woman who is in charge of categorizing the ‘ co-benefits ’ of reduced use of fossil fuels . in other words , there are many benefits other than a better climate from reducing our use of fossil fuels . the health benefits i listed above are one co-benefit . another is the ability to improve the horrible air-quality in mexico city . and the political benefits of not needing oil are also great ( i ’ll talk about that in venezuela ) . i spent my last three days in the city as a tourist . mexico city was built by the spaniards on top of a seasonal lake and the ruins of the aztec civilization . i visited the ruins of the former aztec temple , i walked through the anthropology museum , and i visited the pyramids of teotihuacan ( photo on right ) . now the descendents of these civilizations walk the streets here in mexico city , mixed with the descendents of the spanish conquerors . there is something strange about a massive city that has entirely covered both a natural lake and a former civilization . the reporter i stayed with the last three nights claimed that this gave the city a unique energy . i finally left mexico city , departing on a road that cuts between two 18,000 ft volcanoes ( named popocatepetl and iztacihuatl ) . almost 500 years earlier , hernan cortez , the spanish conquistador , traveled over this pass with a small army and invaded the aztec capital . now the pass is a nice place to bicycle . bogota to bucaramanga monday , june 26th , 2006 after a week in bogota , i departed the city , leaving behind what almost seems routine at this point – a group of new friends , a newspaper appearance , and a city that i hope to return to someday . i was escorted out of town by bruce , an american who helped me out while in bogota . heading northwest towards venezuela ( map ) , i first stopped in the colonial town of zipaquira , where the locals have converted a salt mine into an underground cathedral . continuing on , i was told by everyone that this stretch of road was safe , and i proceeded to camp in the countryside next to families . my first night i camped next to marco ’s family ’s house . marcos cuts clay out of the roadside next to his house , then forms the clay into bricks , and then cooks the bricks with coal to harden them . the majority of colombia ’s buildings are made out of bricks , and apparently this is where they come from . i helped cut some clay ( video center ) , but i think i was more a source of entertainment than assistance . camping next to families in the countryside , i am inevitably asked about money and about what life is like in the u.s. i try to explain that there is a difference between standard of living and quality of life , and that while you make more money in the u.s. , things are also more expensive ( just say what rent in palo alto is ) . but , while most families i see seem to have good family and community lives , the health care is poor and they have nowhere near the options that i or my friends have â € “ minimum wage her is $ 200 a month . ( more thoughts on this in my first comment on this post . ) heading north , i camped next to the houses of a few more families , and followed long scenic valleys and canyons up and down until reaching the city of bucaramanga , another of colombia ’s major cities . final thoughts from buenos aires saturday , march 31st , 2007 i write you from buenos aires , where i am preparing for the return home to the states . my head is still spinning a bit from finishing this trip , and organizing my thoughts is proving to be difficult . nearly 17 months ago i biked out my front door in california and started biking south . just a few days ago i arrived at the end of the road , as far south as i can bike in south america . much happened in these 17 months . i now have personal connections with so many people across the two continents â € “ people whose houses i stayed in or camped next to . i now speak very good spanish , some portuguese , and a few phrases in the native language of quechua ( useful in the mountains of peru ) . i have taken a boat up the amazon , crossed dirt roads over 15,000 ft andean passes , luckily escaped bandits in southern mexico , felt the wind and rain of patagonia , and dodged buses in the capital cities of nearly every country . it is difficult to believe i was able to experience all of this , and looking through my pictures and journals is an emotional experience . global warming is a problem that has no borders and will affect all of us , and to solve it will require all of us to work together . it will cause water problems , deadly storms , agricultural losses , rising sea level , heat waves , and major extinctions on land and in the oceans . we simply do not want a planet with these problems â € “ why should we tolerate these results ? in terms of getting the word out , i had far more success than i expected . i visited over 60 schools , giving talks to thousands of students . i appeared in the national media in nearly every country â € “ whether television , radio , or newspapers . thousands have followed my journey on this site . this success combined with the generosity of all the people i met along the road leaves me feeling optimistic about what is possible . in a few days i will return to the united states , where i am sure i will be shocked by the number of cars and size of houses , if nothing else . many people i have stayed with on this trip , especially in the countryside , live in small houses , are poor , own no car , and have little healthcare . while they would laugh and share food with me , many want what we have , and they would tell me so . i am left with a desire to help these people , but also a sad feeling that we cannot all be rich â € “ under our current system , being rich simply uses too many fossil fuels . if we want the world to be wealthy , we must first figure out how to be rich and not produce so many greenhouse gasses . that is our challenge . i ask you all now to turn your eyes to the next project , ride for climate usa , which my riding partner for that trip , bill bradlee , along with a few excellent volunteers , have been assiduously organizing while i biked . it will be a journey around the united states to promote solutions on global warming , and we will start in boston , massachusetts on april 21st . it is a project that i deeply believe in , as it is clear that the u.s. must take serious action if the world is to succeed . you can contribute to this project here , or check our schedule to see if we are biking near you . now , though , ride for climate the americas is over . this is the last entry in these journals – all future entries will be found on the ride for climate usa blog . thank you again to everyone who was a part of this journey , from those of you i stayed with to those of you who simply sent a small email of support . i hope i have given you a bit of a sense of what it is like to cross the americas one village at a time , and made you feel a little bit connected to the many people who live across these continents . see you at ride for climate usa , david thanks to my excellent sponsors : tarptent , mike ’s bikes of palo alto , chaco , south american explorer ’s club , the bomberos of latin america , and everyone who helped with this trip . miles by country — — — — — usa ( california

547 chile : 2,233 argentina : 2,106 total : 15,921 cartagena and the colombian presidential elections sunday , may 28th , 2006 when i arrived in cartagena , i talked to a few local contacts about how to bike colombia safely . all recommended that it would be safest to travel after the presidential elections , which were to be held that sunday . i found a 5 dollar hotel , and spent a few days in town . cartagena is one of the oldest european cities in south america , founded in the 1530s . the historic downtown is surrounded by city walls to keep out caribbean pirates ( the city was sacked numerous times ) , and the streets are barely wide enough for two horse carriages . the city sits barely above sea level , and , like the islands of the kuna indians , i wondered what the future of the city will be when the ocean level rises . on election day , i walked around the downtown and watched colombians cast their ballots . the ballots were simple â € “ a single piece of paper with pictures of each candidate . mark an x over your candidate , fold the paper , and put it in a box ( ballot shown in the middle below ) . i talked to some of the election officials , who let me take pictures of the process . i found that people were willing to say who they voted for , and i conducted an informal exit poll . of the 20 or so people that i talked to , about 5 did nâ€™t vote , 10 voted for the current president , alvaro uribe , 4 voted for carlos garivia , and 1 for horacio serpa ( because â€˜all of the candidates are corrupt , and he is the least corruptâ€™ ) . the news that night confirmed my exit poll â € “ uribe won over 60 % of the vote . presidents are not usually allowed to run for two terms , but uribe had the constitution changed so that he could run again . his popularity is due to an increase in security – according to every colombian i talk to , the country is far safer now than five years ago . the army has increased in size by over 30 % , and all major roads are heavily patrolled . a school master that i talked to remarked that â€˜a few years ago , my friends would fly to bogota instead of drive â € “ now they drive across the country.â€™ my first night out of cartagena , i stayed on a farm with a man who had been kidnapped and held ransom for three days in 2000 . he said â€˜thanks to godâ€™ after saying that uribe won , and then he told me that it would be safe for me to bike the main roads in colombia . the armed conflict here in colombia is a complicated issue – if you have time , here is an article with more information . i have included as the first comment on this post what i have gained about the war from talking to people – if you have thoughts , feel free to add them . a sail from panama to colombia saturday , may 27th , 2006 as there are no roads between panama and colombia , i spent a few days in the city of colon looking for a boat to colombia . colon is a city where foreigners are regularly held at gun point in the daytime , and i left the marina only to give presentations at a local school as well as the rotary club . i found that yachts , for the same price as a plane ticket , take backpacking travelers between colombia and panama . ( you can potentially get a free ride on a freighter , but only if you are willing to spent lots of time in colon ) . i found a 65 foot yacht , the golden eagle ( probably the best boat making this run ) , headed towards colombia . as i was staying in the marina ( sleeping on different boats ) , i spent some time before departure helping sand the golden eagle â€™s floors . in exchange , the captain told me i could be first mate , which meant i got to get on the boat a day early and sand the floors . we were soon joined by 12 other young travelers from australia , england , the netherlands , canada , south africa , singapore , and the u.s. for the first time this trip , i was surrounded by other travelers . we sailed first to the san blas islands , where we anchored between two small islands . the local kuna indians , who inhabit the islands , canoed up to our boats to sell us locally made clothing . all the islands sit less then a half meter above sea level , and we guessed how many years it would be before they were under water . after two more days of sailing across the caribbean , we arrived in cartagena , colombia , the first stop in south america . copala to durango – 4 days , 163 miles thursday , january 19th , 2006 i spent two days in copala , a picturesque town of about 1,500 people in the steep foothills of the sierra madre occidente , a massive mountain range that hugs the west coast of mexico . copala , a former mining town , now appears to have an economy based on tourism and livestock that make noise early in the morning ( mostly donkeys and chickens ) . in copala i befriended a doctor and former cyclist who raced in the 1961-3 tour de france , an artist who spends one month a year in a vow of silence ( not this month ) , and a young hotel manager who is married to a man more than twice her age ( something that i ’ve seen more than once here ) . in addition to companionship , these people provided me with food , medicine , highly discounted lodging , bicycling advice , and organic , herbal remedies . departing copala , the road climbs to over 6,000 feet in 30 miles , and then continues to climb while hugging an impressive cliff-lined ridgeline literally called ‘ the spine of the devil . ’ it is the only paved road through the sierra madre ocidente for hundreds of miles to the north and south . eventually , the terrain becomes less steep , entering pine forests , but the road continues to climb to over 9,000 feet . the second night out of copala , while camping in the forest at below freezing temperatures , i awoke to find a forest fire ( slowly ) approaching my tent . i decided to move camp . the third night out , i stayed with the family of the doctor ’s mother-in-law , who lived in the village of llano grande high in the mountains . all employment in the village is based on harvesting wood from the forests . about eight members of the extended family shared a lot . dinner was cooked on a wood stove , and i turned on and off the light in the extra room they had by unscrewing the bulb from the socket . i was the first or second gringo that anyone in the family had ever talked to . ( when asked , they said not to put their photos on the internet for the world to see ) . i am now in the city of durango , staying for free at a hotel because i have befriended a man who runs an excellent bicycle touring company and has connections to the tourism industry . if you want to do an economic supported bicycle tour near durango , check out their website ! durango , with a scenic colonial downtown , sits at about 6,000 ft and is filled with about half a million people . lima to cusco – dirt roads in the andes thursday , november 2nd , 2006 leaving lima , i biked south along peru â€™s desert coast . confronting headwinds and fog , i decided to turn inland and followed an impressive canyon into the andes . climbing above 13,000 feet , i found the land was grazed by llamas and alpaca , and one night i even camped next to a flock of llamas ( video and photo bottom left and center ) . after spending a few days in the city of ayacucho ( where i visited institucion educativo luis carranta ) , i continued on , this time on one lane dirt roads through the andes . people live along these roads â € “ every inch of land that can be farmed in the mountains is farmed or grazed . these people do nâ€™t often see foreigners , and everyone wanted to talk to me . everyone along this road speaks quechua , a native tongue , as their first language , yet they almost all also speak spanish . i learned a few useful phrases in quechua ( â€˜i am 27 years oldâ€™ , â€˜i come from the united statesâ€™ , â€˜i am hungryâ€™ , â€˜you are prettyâ€™ ) , and found these extremely useful in making friends along the road . biking by one school , a number of the students rushed out of their recess to talk to me , and i talked to them about my project . the biggest environmental problems here , i think , are deforestation and poor trash disposal . click on the video on the right , and you can see students saying â€˜take care of the environmentâ€™ in quechua . people have little money along this road . the most people make in a given day here is about 10 soles , or 3 dollars , with many making far less . some people beg for money , and people always ask me about money â € “ how much does my bike cost ? how much can you make in the u.s. ? â € “ and these are my least favorite questions . i never tell them how much my bike costs ( i now reply with â€˜how much does your best friend cost?â€™ ) , but it is hard to be fully comfortable knowing that my gear cost far more than it costs to make their houses . everyone i stayed with seems to have enough to eat ( and often share it with me ) , but , one man whose house i camped next to explained that there are people â € “ people who do nâ€™t have land or who have mental problems â € “ along this road who simply do nâ€™t have enough to eat . in one town , some kids came out and pushed my bike from behind , helping me up a hill . they begged for money , and i gave them some bread . they pushed me some more and then one of them opened up the rear of my pannier and tried to steal my tent stakes . i yelled , turned around , and quickly caught the kid . the locals heard me yell , and soon the entire town crowded around me , and we had a friendly but awkward conversation . i got my tent stakes back , but somehow did nâ€™t feel good about it . the majority my interactions , however , were like those i had with edgar . i asked edgar where i could buy matches . he responded by giving me some matches . i gave him my business card . he gave me some oranges . i gave him some cookies and showed him i could count to ten in quechua . he invited me in for lunch , and you can see him on the left in his kitchen . and then there were the 3 different families whose houses i camped next to , and who all invited me and fed me in their kitchens . after many more thousands of feet of climbing and passing an impressive incan ruin , i arrived in abancay , where the pavement began again . after two more days and 12,000 feet of climbing , i rolled into cusco , peru â€™s tourism capital and the former capital of the inca empire . durango to san luis potosi – 6 days , 313 miles thursday , january 26th , 2006 in the past week , i have cut across the high central plateau of mexico . this plateau is dry without great changes in elevation , and the road has stayed between 6,000 and 8,000 ft above sea level . this dry region is rich with minerals , and every town has impressive architecture dating from 16th through 18th centuries , when mines brought these towns ( and spain ) great wealth . according to a doctor i stayed with in the town of fresnillo ( met him on the street while asking directions to the firehouse ) , the area is the world ’s second largest producer of silver . the most impressive city visited was zacatecas , which , at 8,000 feet and 350,000 people , contains a great maze of cobblestone streets and buildings . i stayed an extra day in zacatecas , talked with a school , and then camped atop a building in the center of town , where i encountered my first rain in mexico . ( the shot on the right is of an epic battle i had with pancho villa ) . i have ridden since durango with gregg and brooks , who are riding from alaska to argentina to raise money for diabetes research . i met gregg and brooks back in san diego , only to split ways when my passport was stolen . no , we are not racing , as the movie on the right suggests….(i say this only because it looks like they will beat me ) . it is a different experience riding with other cyclists . the bicycling is more enjoyable , and hotels , when split three ways , sometimes fall within my acceptable limit of $ 5 a night . yet interaction with local peoples is far less , as a group of gringos is more intimidating than an individual . i hope to ride more with gregg and brooks in the future , and there are a number of people that i hope will join me on this trip . but it is also clear that there are great benefits to being alone on the road . ensenada to guerrero negro – 8 days , 432 miles wednesday , december 21st , 2005 the past week has been a long ride through northern baja , camping on roadsides in sparsely populated places . leaving ensenada seven days ago , i charted a course east across the peninsula to avoid traffic on the main highway . as i biked across baja ’s mountains , i was struck by two items ubiquitous on the roadside : crosses marking where a driver has lost his or her life , and trash . a strange , common site is a cross with trash littered at its base . the trash is disgusting , but the crosses make me uneasy , and i watch every car that passes me in the rear view mirror . after two and a half days , i arrived in san felipe , a small town on the gulf of california that is a strange mix of a mexican fishing village and an american beach-front real estate market . signs proclaim , in english , new lots for sale or under construction while most people in town speak no english . the people i talked to said they liked the influx of americans , as they said it provided work . i cooked my dinner on a vacant lot overlooking the sea , and , when the near-full moon rose , took off south again on my bike . amazingly , i soon ran into brando , eloy , and juan , three teenagers from san felipe on their ‘ first ever ’ bike tour . with backpacks they had purchased two days ago and bikes they borrowed from one of their fathers , they were out to camp for the night . i tried to convince them to ride to argentina with me , but they decided to stop only a few miles down the road , where we camped , built a fire , and taught me mexican slang . the next three days , south of san felipe , were slow hard days on a poorly maintained , little used road along the rocky shore . the second of these three days , five cars passed me , and i camped with a hitchhiker from ohio who failed to get a ride and had walked all day . the third day , only one car passed me as the road climbed into the mountains . on the second and third day , i averaged 5mph . rejoining the main highway , i have coasted two easy days south , enjoying pavement and a tailwind . i am now in guerrero negro , in the state of southern baja california ( ‘ baja california sur ’ ) , where i have just washed my clothes and enjoyed a shower . the 1999 floods in venezuela tuesday , july 18th , 2006 in 1999 , it rained for half a month straight and caracas and surrounding states were severely flooded . it is estimated that 30,000 people died as flood waters swept away houses along rivers and landslides destroyed the houses built on hillsides . most of these houses were houses of the poor â € “ the â€˜shantytownsâ€™ that rise up the hillsides and line the river banks . in caracas , i was amazed at how the sides of the valley were packed with houses of the poor . below are some photos i took from afar ( i did not explorer these areas , as i was told they were not safe ! ) floods like the 1999 disaster may become more common as the earth warms â € “ many models predict that there will be more heavy rain storms . cleary , people should build stronger homes in less vunerable areas . but , when the floods do come , it is those who are least able to adapt who will suffer the most . melting glaciers and a climb of vallunaraju monday , october 2nd , 2006 the city of huaraz sits directly beneath the cordillera blanca , a massive mountain range that rises over 22,000 ft and has the world â€™s largest number of tropical glaciers . all of these glaciers , however , are melting rapidly â € “ some studies estimate that over half of the existing glaciers will melt in the next 20 years and , within the next 50 years almost the ice could be gone . in huaraz , i met researchers at inrena ( instituto nacional de recursos naturals ) , who monitor the glaciers . ” everywhere you look ” they told me , ” you can see exposed rock beneath the glaciers or glacial lakes . that is where the glaciers reached less than a century ago . ” in a few days in the mountains , i took the photos below of various glaciers â € “ in every case you can see the glaciers used to reach far below . according to one local , the glacier shown on the right used to reach where i am sitting to take the picture . there are few things i enjoy more than a view across high mountaintops , and , after a mountaineering guide convinced to front the money , i was soon following the guide out of huaraz to attempt a climb of vallunaraju . we would climb the nearly 19,000 ft peak in just one morning , leaving our 14,000 ft base camp at midnight , hiking to the base of the glacier at 16,000 ft , and then using rope and crampons to reach the summit . the morning we choose was perfect â € “ not a cloud in the sky , and , after hiking beneath the stars for hours , we watched the sunrise over the glaciated peaks . climbing further , we neared the top just before 8am . ten meters from the summit , however , we encountered an ice wall that would have required steep climbing with rock cliffs below . although my guide was ready to lead , i decided that i did not need to climb higher , as i was more than happy with the view that we had . loosing these glaciers will cause major water problems in peru , something that i will talk about in my next post . it will also hurt the tourism industry in huaraz as people visit these mountains to see the snow capped peaks . to me personally , though , it is sad to look across these mountains and realize that in 50 years , this view will be gone . guatemala to placencia belize – 6 days , 274 miles friday , march 17th , 2006 after a night in a small guatemalan village ( where i ran into a high school friend ) , i crossed into belize . my friend dennis murphree was flying into the belize city airport that afternoon , and i planned to bike and meet him . i asked the customs agent how many kilometers it was to belize city . the customs agent , a man of african descent , replied in english â€˜i do nâ€™t know how many kilometers it is , but i do know it is 75 miles.â€™ belize is more of a caribbean nation than a central american nation . it was a british colony until 1981 , when it won its independence , and english is the official language . a large portion of the country is of african descent and speaks â€˜creol english.â€™ it is a diverse country , with immigrants from the surrounding hispanic countries as well as indigenous mayan communities . it is also a tiny country . it is the size of massachusetts but with fewer than 250,000 people ( which means convenience stores are far and few between when biking ) . i learned these basic facts about belize from a cyclist who i met on the road ( movie on the right ) . i also learned that cycling is a popular sport here , and i was also impressed with the number of bike racks in belize city . i met dennis , a good friend from college , at the belize city airport . we assembled his bike and rode into belize city for the night . dennis , who has never biked more than 20 miles in a day , is new to bike touring . when he was deciding to join me , i promised we would bike short distances and spend lots of time on the beach . plans change , though , and when he arrived , i told him we were biking 50 miles inland . he was nâ€™t very excited . dennis and i biked one day to the capital of belize , belmopan , a town of 10,000 people , where we met with an organization helping caribbean nations adapt to climate change . the following day i gave a presentation at galen university , a university that attempts to incorporate sustainable development into all of its classes . biking 10 miles down the road , we then spent the night at jaguar creek , an â€˜environmental peaceâ€™ center . turning back towards the coast , dennis and i biked along the base of the maya mountains . fortunately , the road never crossed over the mountains , avoiding any serious hills . dennis reported , much to my relief , that he actually enjoyed bicycling and was not angry for the false advertising . it is , after all , a bicycle tour . stopping to camp for the night , we asked a retired american who moved to belize if we could camp on his lawn . â€˜sure , just one problem . i own a jaguar . i will try to put him inside.â€™ soon , a half-grown 11-month-old jaguar â€˜kittenâ€™ was diving into our stuff , and ran off with dennisâ€™ biking glove . the jaguar then leapt onto dennis leg . his owner tried to put the jaguar inside , but the kitten scratched the man and ran off , this time with dennis ’ bike helmet . recovering the helmet , dennis and i decided it might be better to continue , and we camped on a lawn in maya center , a small town where the locals speak the language maya mopan . the following day , we biked a short distance to placencia , the beach town that i had promised dennis . from here we would visit the coral reefs of belize â € “ reefs that are in great danger from climate change and the reason that i decided to visit belize . guerrero negro to loreto â € “ 4 days , 268 miles monday , december 26th , 2005 leaving guerrero negro early on the 22nd , i biked two days across baja to the town of santa rosalia , an old mining town , which , like the rest of baja , is full of united staters . the scenery has changed as i have ridden farther south , with the mountains becoming more abrupt ( including some volcanoes ) , and the vegetation turning into tall cactus forests . baja california is one of the places in the world where bicycle tourists congregate . i have seen cyclists from holland , england , the united states , and mexico biking the peninsula and carrying camping gear . cylists are still few enough , though , that it is exciting to talk to every one i meet . the next two days , christmas eve and christmas , i rode with two mexican cyclists , áaron and rick , who are professors of electronics at the university itesm in cerétaro . we celebrated christmas eve and morning on a beach looking across concepcion bay , where we cooked dinner , shared biking stories , and then proceeded to teach me mexican slang . i am now in the town of loreto , where i met with the director of the loreto campus of the university autónima de baja california sur . this campus specializes in eco-tourism , and students are to learn about the natural areas surrounding loreto . as it is vacation time , i did not get to meet with any students . i did , though , talk with the director , sam salinas , about the problem of obtaining water in baja california . i will revisit this topic , and how it relates to climate change , in my next entry . biking in l.a. – to hollywood and back friday , november 18th , 2005 after talking with mr. ransom â€™s 9th grade class , i decided to bike through los angles to get a sense of the city . following a city map , i rode 30 miles to hollywood and back . i hoped to talk with cyclists to see how they managed to bike in la. i found only two . one had lost his license , and was forced to bike . i asked if he had trouble with the cars . he replied , â€œrecently , i was hit by a mercedes and then my arm was run over by a lexus.â€ the man then listed his hospital bills . i biked on the sidewalk ( slowly ) afterwards . the climate in l.a. is perfect for year round bicycle commuting , yet few people bike because 1 ) everything is so spread out and 2 ) there are few ( if any ) bikeways or bike lanes . the public transit does work , but only a few people i talked with seemed satisfied with it . most trips are in a car , and in traffic . unfortunately , cars are an inefficient way to travel around a city . a person in a car emits , on average , twice as much carbon dioxide as a person in public transit . also , by comparison , cycling adds almost no carbon dioxide to the atmosphere ( see comment on this ) . i would love to see an l.a. with bike lanes and great public transit . it would require great change , but i think it is possible , and i think the city would be far better for it . through honduras to nicaragua sunday , april 16th , 2006 leaving el salvador , i climbed into the mountains of honduras , continuing my winding route through central america ( see the map of my route ) . returning to honduras , i spent my first night camped outside of a family ’s house in the countryside . like the last honduran family i stayed with , they had no electricity , although they did have many candles and they ran a small store selling refreshments . they invited me into their home , let me cook my dinner on their stove , and showed me pictures of past family events . earlier that day , i drank some water i should not have . that night , i emerged from my tent many times , and one time left a pile of vomit in the lawn near the outhouse . this is not the way to be a good guest . although a dog and the rain immediately cleaned up my mess , the family had heard me , because , as they told me in the morning , they could not sleep because of mosquitoes at night . they said they could not afford a mosquito net . the mother gave me some medicine and wished me well ; i felt bad that i had little to give in return , but i shared some of my food and offered to mail them a copy of a picture i took of them . after spending a day recovering in a hotel in the city of la paz , i biked into tegucigalpa , honduras ’ capital city . the city sits at about 3,000 feet above sea level in the middle of a large valley surrounded by pine forests . here i stayed with marta and carleton , the mother and step-father of a friend of mine from college . carleton runs a school , but it was the week before easter , and all of latin america is on vacation ( i did , however , get an interview on television ) . nonetheless , carleton gave me a tour of the city and told me about how he once ran for mayor of tegucigalpa . he ran on an anti-corruption platform , but then lost the race to a man who , as was later learned , received illegal funding from the government . i continued into nicaragua , which did not change dramatically from honduras . nicaragua is one of the poorer countries in latin america ( see comparison ) . like el salvador , nicaragua had a long civil war during the 1980s . however , in nicaragua , it was the government that was socialist instead of the guerillas attempting to overthrow it . as such , the u.s. massively supported the guerrillas , and also enacted a trade embargo that strangled the country ( the people fighting the government were known as ‘ contras , ’ and you may know of this from the ‘ iran-contra ’ affair ) . now the country is peaceful , and , like el salvador , i felt relatively safe biking . as it was the week before easter , everyone was on vacation , and most people were at the beach or the local swimming hole . on good friday , i passed a family that demanded i join them at the local pool . despite the strange murky color of the pool water , i enjoyed playing tag and diving into the crowded pool . if you have a high-speed connection , you should look at the video on the right . arriving in managua , nicaragua ’s capital , i stopped at the airport to pick up my father , who will be biking with me through nicaragua and costa rica . in an effort to embarrass his son , pops showed up at the airport with the most ridiculous looking bicycle he could possibly find – a folding bike that can fit within a suitcase . with over half a dozen security guards watching us , we quickly assembled his bike , attached the suitcase as a trailer , and biked away from the airport . across the andes to huaraz – horse assisted bike touring wednesday , september 27th , 2006 from uchiza , on the east side of the andes , i had planned to take a road which turned out to be only a horse trail . eager to get in the mountains i did the only logical thing : i found a guide , disassembled my bicycle , rented a horse , and started walking . this trail was not through the wilderness – along the sides were coffee plantations , and every few hours we would pass a small village , where we could buy food or camp for the night . the last town we stayed in , san pedro , even had some electricity ( but all transit was by horse ) . the woman shown on the right with her 4 children fixed us dinner for $ 1 a piece . i asked people along this trail if they had ever seen a gringo on the trail before . most said no , a few cited italian volunteers for the church who had passed through , and one older woman said ‘ why yes ! some tall foreign women passed through here 22 years ago ! ’ and then she went on to describe the tall strange women . the third day we met up with the road , i mounted the bike , crossed a 12,500 ft pass , and descended into the town of huacrachuco . from huacrachuco , i continued east on a one lane dirt road , passing only two cars a day . i dropped into a deep dry river canyon before climbing again into the next range of the andes . at higher altitude , i encountered more small towns , finding that here the locals speek the native language of quechua . if you want to see my try to count to ten in quechua , click on the video on the right . passing through more towns and more climbs and descents on one lane dirt roads , i eventually climbed into the cordillera blanca , peru â€™s highest mountain range , with peaks reaching over 22,000 ft. after camping two nights at 14,000 feet overlooking a huge glacier , i mounted my bike and crossed a 16,000 ft mountain pass , the highest in peru . i am now in huaraz , a major tourism center , where i will use some emergency funds to get a new digital camera ( mine broke right before the pass ) and then return to take more pictures of the melting glaciers . huaraz to lima sunday , october 15th , 2006 leaving huaraz , i climbed a 13,500 ft pass , camped one more night in the mountains , and then , in one day , descending to the coast ( see map ) . the peruvian coast is one of the driest deserts in the world , and apart from irrigated land , roadside vegetation almost entirely disappeared , giving way to rock and sand . the coast , despite being in the tropics , was actually quite cool and covered in a thick fog due to cool ocean currents . the people living here , however , still let me camp next to their house . continuing south , i soon entered lima , peru â€™s capital city and where 9 million people , or one third of peru â€™s population , lives . entering large cities in latin america gives me perhaps the largest rush i get on this trip â € “ probably because it is scary â € “ and i biked for two hours across the urban land , assisted by a few bike routes , before arriving where i would stay for a week . as with all major cities , the outskirts are filled with shantytowns of poorer houses that i pass before entering a section of the town where the middle and upper classes live . i stayed with jose , a friend of a reporter that i stayed with while in mexico city . jose is an editor for el peruano , peru â€™s second biggest newspaper , and although he works more than12 hours a day , i got to know his family fairly well . i also found that staying at the house of a newspaper editor is the best way to get in the news ( nice article written by jose on the right ) . ( i was also interviewed by a television station , but did nâ€™t watch the news to find out . ) in lima , i was busy . i gave two school presentations , attended a conference on sustainable transportation , visited a team designing bike routes for lima , met with people styding the effects of global warming in peru , spent some time hanging out at the south american explorer ’s clubhouse , and also tried to be a tourist for two days , visiting museums . i left the city with yet another list of people who opened their doors to me , who i hope to see again , and who i have promised a letter to from argentina . ( family friends from home – the vexlers , shown left – also made a cameo appearance as they were on vacation for a week in peru – thanks for the dinner ! ) hurricanes , climate change , and central america tuesday , april 18th , 2006 since arriving in central america , i have asked nearly every person i have stayed with about how hurricanes have affected their lives . in belize , the majority of the population lives in coastal settlements that are barely above sea level . the town where i learned to scuba dive , placencia , was almost completely destroyed by hurricane iris in 1991 . people with insurance or in the tourism industry have rebuilt . others sold their land and moved . down the road from placencia is sand bite , a small town that does not receive tourism dollars . this town has not fully rebuilt from the storm . hurricanes are likely to be stronger on a warmer earth . a recent study ( here is a description ) showed how an increase in the power of atlantic hurricanes over the past 20 years is correlated with warmer ocean water in the atlantic . this makes intuitive sense – hurricanes get their energy from warm ocean water , and warmer ocean water should mean more powerful hurricanes . more powerful hurricanes are also predicted by climate models . furthermore , much of the damage done by hurricanes is not just by their winds , but by the rain that accompanies the storms . a warmer atmosphere can hold more water , and thus will likely provide heavier rains ( read more on rains here ) . in 1998 , a huge category 5 hurricane , hurricane mitch , tore through the caribbean and then parked itself over central america , affecting almost every country . ten thousand people died , and over 100,000 were left homeless . the storm hit honduras the hardest . it destroyed some coastal communities and then dropped amazing amounts of rain . a security guard at the san pedro sula airport described water in his house up to his armpits . a family who i stayed with in the countryside told me that they lost all of their crops . i asked what they did that year , and they replied that they were hungry that year . in tegucigalpa , the flooding reached the third floor of some buildings ( such as the building on the left ) . according to my city guide carleton , many of the houses on the hill sides washed away . he showed me a large section of bare earth ( shown on the right ) where there used to be houses . the destruction continued in the rest of central america . in san miguel , el salvador , one man described a landslide that destroyed many homes . in nicaragua , the family that i swam with on good friday invited me back to their house . their house had been destroyed by mitch , and rebuilt a year later by help from the government ( photo left ) . also in nicaragua , i spent one night at the house of cristina , who is shown on the right . cristina explained that although no one in her community died , they lost all of their animals . “ we ate a lot of rice and beans . ” mitch was so strong that its name has been retired – whereas most names for storms are reused after a few years , meteorologists will never again use the name mitch . if current research is correct , though , we will see more storms like mitch . and , the people who will suffer the most will be the people who i have met here in central america – people who live in poorly constructed houses , who live on vulnerable slopes , or who rely on the food they grow to live . based on these stories , it seems that the human toll of hurricane mitch was many times worse than any storm in the u.s. again , this is because of how people live here â € “ they have fewer resources to survive and recover from a storm . yet , growing up in the u.s. , for a long time i thought that hurricanes damaged only florida and nearby states because that is what i heard about in the media . somehow we need to expand our view to other countries , especially as our actions â € “ emissions of greenhouse gasses â € “ will make storms worse internationally . cartagena to medellin – into the andes monday , june 5th , 2006 leaving cartagena , i charted a course south , biking through hot lowlands for a few days before climbing into the andes and the city of medellin . my advice was to bike in the daytime ( which i do anyway ) , and stay only in the towns â € “ do nâ€™t camp in the country side . i stayed with a family , at two firestations , and a series of cheap hotels ( $ 4 to $ 7 a night ) . the route sees few foreigners , and nearly every person on the roadside asked me â€˜â¿de donde viene?,â€™ or where do you come from . they asked in a friendly manner , and i felt obliged to talk to each person ( which can be tiring if you are surrounded by children â € “ see video center ) . in the town of caucasia , i befriended a man at the municipal building who then invited me to talk at the local school . the military presence along these roads is impressive . every few kilometers , there are men in uniform with automatic rifles patrolling the road . i found these men to be friendly , and i felt safe with them on the road . i later learned that although it is generally safe to bike this area , it is â€˜paramilitary central,â€™ and one of my email contacts told me that a mass grave was recently found near one of the cities i stayed in . ( the men in uniform on the road were from the army , not the paramilitaries â € “ read more about who the paramilitaries are here ) . the last few days of the trip were difficult , including an 8,000 feet climb into the andes . i was impressed that both in the lowlands and the highlands , the countryside is entirely cleared for cattle grazing . biking through the mountains , encountering occasional cold rain , the road eventually descended into the valley where the city of medellin , colombia â€™s second largest city , sits . south into argentina monday , december 11th , 2006 i spent a week in la paz , where i talked to almost the entire american school . i also somehow managed to get in two major newspapers , three radio stations , and a morning live interview on national television ( the program â€˜al despertar,â€™ for those of you who tune into bolivian television… ) from la paz , i basically started biking south as fast as i could , and i am now in northern argentina . i have been traveling fast for a few reasons â € “ the end of the school year ( southern hemisphere summer ) means i ca nâ€™t give presentations , i have a desire to not be rushed later in the trip , and i made a promise to meet a friend who is flying in to bike with me . the terrain has been breathtaking . i crossed the world â€™s largest salt flat , and biked across the atacama desert , crossing sections of the desert by moonlight . there were few services on these roads – at one point had to carry 30lbs of food and water . click on the images below to visit the photo albums of the past few weeks . southern bolivia , including the world â€™s largest salt flat ( biked partially with wouter ) : the atacama desert of chile , including some incredible night biking : northern argentina , where i am now . i caught up with brooks and gregg ( and another cyclist tom ) . remember gregg and brooks ? i biked across sections of mexico with them , and just ran into them again : transportation in lima tuesday , october 17th , 2006 biking across the cities of latin america , i have become interested in the quality of transportation in these cities , and , of course , how easy these cities are to bicycle . ( see what i thought of los angeles , mexico city , bogotã¡ , and caracas ) . during my week in lima , i crossed the city several times , logging 150 miles on my bicycle . with over 9 million people , lima has no mass transit system , and only an inefficient system of busses . few limans own cars , so most use the busses , which i found to be always slower than using my bicycle ( see video on right for extreme example ) . so , do people bike in lima ? there are a few bike lanes ( 60 km ) , but they are of low quality . i got up early one morning to see if people used the bike lanes to commute ( like they do in bogota â € “ for comparison , see these pictures ) , and i saw few cyclists ( see videos below ) . the city is flat , never rains , and has a cool comfortable climate â € “ it is a perfect place for bicycle use , yet the infrastructure to do so is poor . ( at the office where people work on bike lanes , only one out of four people bikes to work . ) in the next few decades , cities like lima have a choice – support individual car use , or support mass transit and non-motorized transit . if cities support car use , as the economy grows and more people can afford cars , their greenhouse gass emissions will grow rapidly , worsening global warming . if cities choose a less car intensive path , the city will not only produce less pollution but also probably be more livable . to develop sustainable transportation , a city needs not only good ideas and investment , it needs the people to support such projects . one problem , as i see it , is that many latin americans look to our cities in the u.s. as models for how to develop their spaces – the people are more likely to support projects that make their cities look like u.s. cities . and i will let you decide for yourself how to fix that problem . loreto to la paz – 4 days , 234 miles saturday , december 31st , 2005 in loreto , i discovered the firehouses . firemen often have extra beds at their stations , and seem to be very friendly to gringos biking and talking about climate change . i stayed with the friendly bomberos ( spanish for firemen ) in loreto before heading south , following the road first along the shore and then southwest across baja . southwestern baja is a large coastal plain , where a number of crops are grown by pumping water from deep underground . fields of corn grow strangely next to fields of cacti . stopping at a gas station , i met rafael , who owned both the store and a small herd of goats . in exchange for a short english lesson , rafael let me watch while he killed and gutted a young goat . i think rafael got the better end of the deal . i stayed with the firemen in ciudad de constitución , where i watched a jakie chang movie dubbed in spanish . i then rode two days back southeast across the peninsula to la paz , the largest city in southern baja . at the suggestion of a local , upon arriving to town , i went to the local news . in less than an hour , without a shower , i was live on television , answering questions about bicycling and climate change . i am in la paz now , where i will be for a few days trying to hitch a ride on one of the yachts sailing for the mainland . i am staying in the extra bunks with the generous and extremely friendly local firemen . the fireman sleep downstairs because , as they say , the upstairs is haunted by their former chief , who passed away 4 months ago . after saying words of appreciation for the generosity of firemen , i have slept comfortably upstairs , by myself . ventura to los angeles â € “ 1 day , 73 miles wednesday , november 16th , 2005 for a day in ventura , in addition to visiting schools , i watched surfers , sat at the beach for sunset , and visited patagonia . i stopped by the headquarters of environmental friendly and profitable patagonia , which generates a large portion of their electricity from photovoltaic cells over their parking lot . i also met three cyclists riding south from vancouver with their own environmental web log . after staying at the house of a teacher at cabrillo middle school , i left at dawn to try to avoid the santa ana winds . passing a navy base , i followed the pacific coast highway along the coastal mountains , passing through malibu and santa monica before turning towards west los angeles where i met my friend julia goodnough . machu picho , cusco to bolivia , and a year on the road wednesday , november 15th , 2006 on the one year anniversary of my journey â € “ a year of bicycling from california â € “ i took a train to see the ruins of machu pichu , the famous incan ruins that were never destroyed by the spanish ( they were n’t found ) . it is difficult to believe everything that i have seen in this year â € “ this trip has exceeded all of my expectations , from my ability to meet people to my ability to talk to schools to the quality of scenery that i have pedaled by . i do miss friends and family from home , but i am usually simply overwhelmed by this journey . i have 5 months left and a few thousand miles of biking left , and i can only hope that the last 5 months will be as enjoyable and productive as the past 12 . i also spent time in the city of cusco , the former capital of the incan empire . here , in addition to marveling at old incan walls , i visited la salle school in cusco , talking both to the morning assembly and a class of seniors ( and was then interviewed for a local television program ) . i also gave a talk to the south american explorer â€™s club , one of my sponsors , and also a great place to get information and spent time . leaving cusco , i met another cyclist also heading south . wouter , a former bartender from belgium and roughly my age , arrived ten months ago in mexico city with a 100 dollar bicycle , two home made panniers , some savings , and not much of plan as to where he was going to bike . having never bike toured before , he rode to panama with some other cyclists , and then decided he might as well also ride to patagonia ( he purchased a trailer in ecuador , which is what you see him riding with in these photos ) . while i do enjoy traveling alone , it was great to have a riding partner for the first time in many months , and we shared stories of biking mexico , central america , colombia , and peru as we biked the week from cusco to bolivia along a road that looped around the giant lake titicaca . we are now in la paz , the capital of bolivia . two weeks up the amazon river wednesday , september 6th , 2006 from the city of manaus , i biked to the river port , where i found a boat headed upriver towards peru . a space to put a hammock and food for six days of travel cost $ 100 . i purchased a ticket , a hammock , and then made friends with a colombian-spanish couple who had a cabin on the boat and would guard my valuables while i slept in my hammock . the river here is enormous â € “ in manaus , 1,000 miles upstream from the amazon â€™s mouth , the river is already by far the world â€™s largest river ( over 150,000 cubic meters of water per second ) , and over 300 feet deep . manaus is a large city of 3 million people , yet the other side of the river is almost unpopulated . my boat followed the largest of the amazon tributaries ( sometimes called the solimoes , sometimes called the amazon ) , upstream towards peru ( see map ) . to maintain sanity while on the boat , i woke up every day at sunrise and ran laps on the deck ( see video , centerâ € “ i had company ) . this was followed by a shower , reading until lunch , lunch , more reading , a nap until dinner , dinner , and then talking with other people on the boat until bedtime . it was a demanding schedule . the boat did make a few stops in small towns along the way , unloading goods and picking up passengers . most of the riverside , however , was unpopulated . arriving upstream , peru , colombia , and brazil â€™s borders all meet , and in the course of a day , i visited all three before boarding another boat , this time a high speed cruiser ( shown left below ) to take a one day trip to iquitos ( map ) . iquitos , with half a million inhabitants , is the world â€™s largest inland city with no roads to it â € “ you can get there only by boat or plane . in the late 1800s , the town experienced a brief boom from rubber production , which produced a number of now-historic buildings in the town â€™s center . i intended to go to the fire station to ask if i could stay there , but never made it , as two families offered me a place to stay first . unable to choose between them , i resolved the problem by staying three days , giving me enough time to also visit two schools and appear in the local paper . i also received a tour of the town from three high school students , and also visited an aids clinic ( perhaps one of the saddest parts of this trip ) with a group working for the catholic church . from iquitos , i took a two and a half day trip upriver to yurimaguas . the trip–food included–cost less than 30 dollars , and only after paying did i realize that i had paid for first class hammock space â € “ second class , in the floor below , cost 15 dollars . i have now arrived in yurimaguas , a small city in the jungle , thus ending my two weeks of boat travel on the world â€™s largest river system . from here there are a series of small dirt roads that i will be able to follow southwest and into the peruvian andes . mazatlán to copala – 4 days , 56 miles friday , january 13th , 2006 after one day in the marina attempting to recover from seasickness , i tried to leave town . after eight miles , realizing i was still too sick , i pulled into the firehouse , where i spent the next 12 hours mostly asleep while the firemen traded ringtones between their phones . i pedaled an easy 30 flat miles the next day , arriving in the town of concordia at the foothills of the mountains . immediately upon leaving town , i was struck by the greenness of the place–there are forests , singing birds , and even a few lizards on the roadside . most of the rain falls here in the summer months , and this is the dry season , yet , in comparison to baja , it was incredible . i tried to leave concordia , a town of about 10,000 , the next morning , but puked and returned to my cheap hotel room for the rest of the day . the following morning , i thought i was well enough to bike , and i rode 15 miles uphill to the small town of copala . unable to continue , i sought out the local pharmacy and decided to stay put until my stomach stopped doing the things you do n’t want to post about on the internet . medellin to bogota monday , june 12th , 2006 i entered the city of medellin , colombia ’s second largest , on a sunday morning . every sunday in medellin , they have the â€˜ciclovia,â€™ where a number of roads are closed to cars ( see video on left ) . i rode in quite happily , and met a local , lucho , who showed me around to the city â€™s many parks before afternoon rain showers . most people in medellin asked me how the city compared to what i had heard about it in the news ( ‘ how does medellin seem to you in comparison to how it is painted on television?â€™ ) i of course tell the truth – medellin is a beautiful city , and i felt just as safe in the city as any other city on this trip . it is clear to me that colombians are upset about their reputation , and , especially in medellin , i felt like they all wanted me to go home and tell everyone what a great place it is . in medellin , i stayed three nights with the firefighters , who showed me the town ( this time in a fire truck ) , helped me get in the local paper and on television , and set up a presentation for a group of teachers . i also now am carrying five items that say â€˜bomberos de medellin.â€™ thanks again to this group of firefighters , who are definitely on the â€˜receive a letter from argentinaâ€™ list . ( can you spot the ‘ fake bombero ’ in the picture on the left ? ) the video on the right above shows how a bombero celebrates his birthday . leaving medellin , i followed the road over the mountains , into the magdalena river valley , and then back up into the mountains towards bogota . it has rained heavily almost every day , but when the rain has stopped , i have received vistas of steep mountains or large rivers high from the recent rains . mexico city to oaxaca – 8 days , 351 miles wednesday , february 22nd , 2006 after two days of bicycling from mexico city , and crossing over a 12,000 ft pass between two volcanoes , i arrived in the town of cholula , a suburb of the large city of puebla and the site of a major pre-colombian city . in the center of cholula , ruins of a giant pyramid are covered by dirt and now appear to be a large hill , with , of course , a church on top ( see photo left ) . i gave four presentations for the american school of puebla , and stayed two days with a teacher at the school . heading south , i rode four days to oaxaca ( pronounced wa-hawk-ah ) through some of the most mountainous terrain yet . the first two days i traveled through dry desert country that , further south , gave way to pine forests . i camped one night on the roadside , one night in the small town of santa maria tutla ( photo right ) , and one night in the small town of monte frio . in monte frio , a town of no more than a thousand upon a ridgetop , i camped next to the municipal building , where the mayor and a whole host of kids stood and watched me cook dinner . afterwards , i joined about 10 local kids in a game of soccer ( video center ) , which we played until the ball was kicked over a cliff . then we played basketball . afterwards , one of the kids asked me to help him translate a book he had in english . i agreed , and he soon returned with his homework . this is a small town , with little available work , and most of the people , like the other small towns i have visited , eat the corn they grow on their fields . also , many go to the u.s. to look for work . more on this later . monarchs , deforestation , poverty , and climate change friday , february 10th , 2006 the butterflies i visited last week congregate in the millions at the tops of mountains in the center of mexico . they choose these places because they have the perfect conditions for surviving the winter â € “ conditions that are now threatened . the butterflies that are wintering here are mostly hibernating . while the skies were full of butterflies , there were even more ( believe it or not ) hanging motionless on the trees . what they need is a cool dry climate to survive these winter months , before returning to northeastern north america in the spring . ( read more about their life cycle . ) according to a recent study ( read a less technical summary here ) , it is likely that in this region of mexico , there will be more winter rain . winter rain is currently extremely uncommon ( like rain in the summer in california ) . it is cold at 11,000 feet , and moisture with freezing conditions kills the butterflies . in 2002 , a january storm killed over 70 % of the butterflies , and conditions bad enough to destroy all butterfly habitats may be prevalent by 2050 . this study relies on predictions of future rainfall , which are not as reliable as predictions of future temperatures â € “ the rain predictions may be wrong . if the butterflies have to move to a new place to find conditions where they can survive the winter , however , they may be in big trouble , as people are likely to be already living there . * wpg2 cannot locate gallery2 item by * indeed , the butterflies are threatened by deforestation as well , most of it illegal , as this region is , in theory , protected . on the ride up the mountains , i saw a number of electric saws turning trees into furniture . it is more complicated . the people living near the butterflies are poor . the trail entrance to the butterfly sanctuary was full of shops pedaling trinkets and young children begging for money . it was actually the least safe place i have felt yet on this trip , and i asked to camp inside the park instead of at the entrance where most people camp . camped less than a kilometer from the butterflies , i heard a subwoofer down the hill beating out a baseline , suggesting that the area was not well protected . the next day , i was surprised how poorly maintained the trail to the butterflies was , as thousands of tourists trampled random trails down a steep mountain side . the rising oceans friday , march 16th , 2007 i am sitting in an internet cafe in punta arenas , chile , right now , doing web searches to figure out just how big of a problem sea level rise will be . the sea level has already risen over the past century , although only about one inch . as more glacial ice melts , what will it do from here on ? the most likely result is not that bad – maybe a foot and a half this century . this could be very bad for many places i have visited â € “ especially along the caribbean coastâ€”and also make storms much worse , not to mention erode some nice beaches . but i might not call it a disaster . the problem , though , is that it takes a long time for ice sheets to melt , and we do nâ€™t really know how long that is . in the â€˜long run,â€™ which could be centuries or millennium , with a likely 3 degree c warming , the ocean could rise 80 feet . we do nâ€™t know if it is centuries or millennium , because computer models for ice sheets are very inaccurate . if it is centuries , as some argue , the oceans could rise much faster than we would like – maybe a foot a decade . and , again , we do nâ€™t know , but , well , do we want to find out ? as i have said before , i am in punta arenas right now . punta arenas sits on the shore of the straight of magellan on the southern tip of south america , and is just one of the many cities on the coast that i have visited . throughout this entry i have interspersed photos of the coastlines i have visited on this trip – take a look at them and envision what a 1 foot , 10 foot , or 80 foot sea level rise would look like . the andean paramo – the future of the mountaintops monday , june 19th , 2006 before biking out of bogota , a young professor from a local university took me into the mountains that overlook the city . andres and i drove from 8,500 feet at bogota to 11,000 feet and the national park of chingaza . at this elevation , the pine forests give way to wet grassland known as the andean paramo . hidden in the fog , andres charged ahead , and i followed through a strange forest of dwarf palm like plants , which can be 100 years old even though they stand only a few feet tall . according to andresâ€™ gps , we climbed up to about 12,500 feet , where the temperatures were in the low 40s . the region is a national park and protected because much of bogota ’s drinking water flows out of these highlands . the ground is rich in organic matter , and thus serves as a huge sponge , which stores water , cleans it , and releases it slowly , so that even in drier months there is a steady flow of water out of the park . you can get a sense of how sponge-like the ground is from the movies below center and left . on the right , i am drinking water straight from the steam ( it was really good water ) . over the past few hundreds of thousands of years , the earth has oscillated between cold spells , known as ice ages , and warm periods , such as we have today , known as interglacial periods . according to recent research , during the ice ages , the paramo grasslands could be found further down the mountains , covering a far larger area . during warm periods , such as today , the paramo is restricted to the mountaintops , literally islands of grassland in the andes . climate change this century will likely push the planet far warmer than it has seen during these past glacial and interglacial cycles , and the paramo will have to move further up the mountainsides . but the ecosystem is already at the mountaintops , with nowhere to go , and the region is at risk . a drastically warmer earth might remove the paramo ecosystem , removing not only the valuable water storage and filtering it provides for bogota , but also losing many unique species which are found only in this high andean ecosystem . before leaving , we ran into a group of park rangers who study small deer that live in the park . andres pulled out hot colombian coffee in a thermos , some sandwiches , wine , and chocolate , and we all enjoyed a picnic between mountain lakes . not for the first time on this trip , i wondered if future generations would be able to enjoy the same place where i was standing . peru monday , october 16th , 2006 as i said in the last entry , peru ’s coast is home to one of the driest deserts in the world . despite the constant fog , it almost never rains â € “ my tour guide for an exhibit in lima told me that the last time there was heavy rain was 35 years ago . all of the water for the city comes from the mountains , where it falls as rain or snow and then melts , filling the rivers . during the dry season , half of the year , almost all of the water is from melting snow and ice . unfortuantely , almost all of these glaciers are going to melt and dissapear in the next 50 years . it is unclear where peruvians will get their water from when the glaciers are gone . the country â€™s energy supply is also at risk . according to people i talked to at proclim , a project aimed at preparing peru for global warming , 80 % of peru â€™s electricity is hydroelectric , and , during the dry season , 80 % of the water in the dams is from glacial runoff . unless investment for huge new dams is found , peru might have to switch to using fossil fuels to produce its electricity . all of this will take place in a country where i have already seen many water problems . most of the towns and cities i have been in ( including parts of lima ) have certain hours of the day when the city does not provide water . in one rural area east of the cordillera blanca , i met a man working for the government whose job it is to resolve water disputes . â€˜it is a big problem here . i have to make sure that each day the water goes to a different house.â€™ a farmer i stayed with near the coast pointed to a number of his crops and said that they would be twice as high if not for a shortage of water . and every person who lives near a stream tells me the same story : the streams are more variable than they used to be . in the dry season there is less water , and in the rainy season there is more â € “ just as one would expect from a decreasing snow pack . ( to be fair , this is also due to deforestation as well as loss of snow and ice . ) loosing the glaciers and snow of the mountains will be a major loss for peru . the only solution may be to build many new resivours in the mountains . but , what valleys will they choose to flood ? what will happen to the people living in these valleys ? and , how will peru , a poor country , find the investment for such expensive projects ? 02-jan-2010 -- on the way back from our winter sports holiday the confluence point 48n 10e was situated only a few kilometres away from the autobahn a96 resp . a7 . such an opportunity should be taken . the gps routed us through the village ‘ rot an der rot ’ . in a very friendly atmosphere we saw an affectionately restored monastery building . furthermore the trip lead us into the village of spindelwag . woodwork seems to play an important role here . on the one hand i never saw more palettes on a heap before . on the other hand a big wooden hull was produced over the street . after about 1,000 meters we reached the confluence point on a court from a homestead . in these late hours i did n't wanted to disturb anybody , so i did my short confluence dance without the approval of the owners . apart from the noises of the live stock in the stable i could n't hear anything or see anybody . despite the darkness the needed pictures turned out quite well . the gps reception was very good and stable in spite of the buildings around . 22-mar-2008 -- on our easter holiday trip to munich i convinced the family to visit this beautiful confluence . after having left the highway , it´s only a short trip through augsburg and some smaller villages to come to this point . we drove some small roads along nice bavarian meadows and stopped about 500 m away from the confluence . from here we had a wonderful view on the alps while dancing towards the desired zeros . after taking our pictures we continued our trip to munich and the bavarian alps where we went skiing for one perfect day . 26-nov-2004 -- the initial plan was to meet up with my brother and sister who were over from blighty visiting some relations in ingolstadt that we had n't seen in along time . instead of rushing there , visiting some people , and rushing back , we decided to leave early and visit cp 48n 12e on the way . we left salzburg at around 11 a.m. driving along the a8 ( main salzburg - munich autobahn ) , via rosenheim to aßling and then towards ebersberg before turning off down the road that took us to the cp . we stopped before the bridge over the stream . the cp was located a few metres into the adjacent field . i had hoped the ground would be frozen so i could walk into the field with my normal shoes , take the necessary photos , and clear off . the weather had been quite cold a few days before but now we were experiencing a warm period ( 6 degrees centigrade and beautiful sunshine ) and the field was muddy , to say the least . so it was on with my walking boots ( i was never a scout but i am always prepared - some of my friends would disagree ) and into the field . luckily i did not have to do any dancing ( have you ever danced in mud ? ) as the zeroes came up immediately and stayed there . the differential gps assisted accuracy showed 2 metres . we took a short walk to the infamous spd meridian stone and up to the bridge , took some more photos and decided to head for ingolstadt . we were behind schedule again but that did n't matter - it was a beautiful sunny day and we 'd just successfully visited a confluence point . 02-aug-2005 -- continues from 48n 26e . after an easy entry to romania we visited the church of pătrăuţi . there we met the priest , who was building a new wooden church to prevent the old one from damage . he gave us an very interesting guide of the church 's history . it is painted outside at one wall and also inside it is completely painted . then passing suceava and botoşani we headed to săveni , where we took road 29 towards manoleasa . this road brought us to a distance of 410 m to 48n 27e , so it is not very difficult to find the point ! we parked our car beside the hardly used street . only some horse-drawn trolleys with hay came along from time to time . so we entered a huge field-area again and walked around a corn-field and through a sunflower-field to a meadow , where we easily could locate the cp . back at the car we headed on to iaşi and on the way along the river prut we were able to see the country moldavia at the other edge . continues at 46n 15e 12-may-2008 -- this is the second out of two confluence points that i visited on a bicycle trip from zurich into the vosges mountains and the black forest . the story starts from 48°n 7°e . on confluence day , i started cycling at 5:30 a.m. in the village midlach in the vosges mountains . i came through the city of colmar and entered germany at the border town brisach . at noon time , i reached freiburg – a city that is located 10 km west of the confluence . from freiburg , a nice bike-path along the dreisam creek leads to the village stegen ( 4 km from cp ) . from here , a narrow valley of the eschbach stream follows upwards to the confluence . at a small village called obertal ( 510 m from cp ) i left the main road and searched for some tracks that would lead upwards to the confluence point . my approach was quite complicated ; i detoured to the top of the hill to a place with a wayside cross and some nice benches . from this viewpoint ( 300m from cp ) i could see the highest peak of the snow covered feldberg ( 1494 m ) . i parked my bicycle and continued on foot by climbing down a steep grade directly towards the confluence point – passing by some grazing cows . straight away i could see the unique marker of the point : a green sail from a windsurfing board with the inscription “ am 18.07.07 hier war die 4 . klasse der grundschule stegen-eschbach . konfluenz-punkt ” which means ‘ on 18th july 2007 here has been the fourth grade elementary school stegen-eschbach . confluence-point ’ . even though i consider such markers as pollution , i followed the slogan of the confluence project which says “ take nothing but pictures , leave nothing but footprints ” . so i kept the sail as it was . getting a perfect zero reading turned out to be a lengthy back and forth – which is normally the case at densely forested steep grades . with 4 m accuracy , i finally located the confluence about 6 m west of the sail directly at the track . when i took the picture of the gps , the accuracy turned to 5 m again . let me here consider an interesting geographical feature : the vosges mountains and the black forest are two related mountain ranges with similar heights ( 1424 m and 1494 m ) . both are aligned north-south , one is in france and the other in germany . they are geological related and divided from each other by the rhine rift . the upper rhine river runs in the middle of that valley which is also the country border . interestingly , both mountain ranges have comparable confluences : 48°n 7°e ( in france ) and 48°n 8°e ( in germany ) . both are located in upper valleys that open out in the rhine rift . both have similar heights ( 730 m and 555 m ) , both are in a mixed spruce and beech forest at steep grades . while visiting both confluence points , i noticed these striking similarities . maybe 40 million years ago , before the rift had formed , they had been together at one location . after documentation i went back to freiburg , where i took a train back home to zurich . unfortunately i had to be in office the next day which did not leave riding back by bike as an option . cp visit details : time at the cp : 14:10 pm riding time : 6 hours riding distance :

school presentation , i arrived at santa rosa de viterbo , a good public school , just as students were arriving . the entire school was gathering for their morning assembly of announcements and prayer ( it is a catholic school ) , and , after handing the director my business card and showing off my fully loaded touring bike , the director surprised me by immediately leading me on stage and handing me the microphone , giving me five minutes to talk to the entire school . what do i say to these public schools , where they do n’t have a power point projector and where the students have a very small effect on global warming ? ( see comparison of u.s. and peru ) i first admit that my country pollutes enourmaously and has to take action â € “ and for that , when i am done , i am going to return and bike the u.s. , encouraging north americans to act . but i also emphasize that i am talking about a global problem which we all need to work together to solve . i then talk about local pollution and global pollution â € “ asking if it is fair to throw trash in the rivers or streets when that space is shared by the people in their town , or if it is fair to pollute the atmosphere when that space is shared by the world â€™s 6.5 billion people ( i ask them all to learn that number ! ) . as many of them own bicycles , i finally talk about the benefits of bicycle transport as a cheaper and healthier way to travel . at the least , i hope to give an idea of caring for the spaces that we share , and i want to show that there are people in the united states that care about this . it is impossible to measure the effect of visits like this , but i occasionally receive positive emails from students , suggesting that i am , at least , having some effect . south into the amazon tuesday , august 15th , 2006 heading south from puerto ordaz/ciudad guyana ( the city seems to have two names ) , i followed the only road that connects venezuela and brazil . thinly populated , this road follows jungle before climbing into a region known as â€˜la gran sabana,â€™ a high grassland with strange flat toped mountains and many rivers and waterfalls . ( this is where angel falls , the world â€™s tallest waterfall , is found â € “ it was too far off my route , though ) . i slowed down through this part , camping on the high mesas and swimming in the many pools , meeting vacationing venezuelans at the same time . entering brazil , the road descended from the mountains into the amazon basin , where , after two days of riding , i arrived in the city of boa vista . before entering town , i went swimming with a few teenagers ( photo right ) . i asked the kids if i should worry about piranhas or crocodiles , to which they said â€˜do nâ€™t worry about it.â€™ in brazil , unlike almost every country i have visited , the language is portuguese instead of spanish . fortunately , spanish and portuguese are very similar languages , and sometimes i almost understand what people say . also , some important phrases , such as â€˜where is the fire stationâ€™ are almost the same in both languages . in boa vista , where i stayed for two days , i gave a talk at a middle school . i was able to say a few words in portuguese , and , whenever what i said was unintelligible , the teacher next to me would repeat what i said in portuguese ( many people here understand spanish ) . the bombeiros ( firefighters ) , who i stayed with two nights , also had time to help me congegate verbs , and , when i was interviewed by the local television , i mostly understood the questions and gave responses that might have been understood . continuing south , i followed the only major road through this section of the amazon . while most of this region is pure jungle , and there are very few people and towns , about half the time the roadside is cleared for cattle grazing . the cleared land , however , did make it easier to see the many types of birds ( the shot on the right shows me crossing the equator ) . further south , however , a 75 mile stretch of road is indigenous land , reserved for the native peoples , and this is pure jungle . the natives do not like outsiders on their land , and you are only allowed to pass this section during the daytime , and you are not allowed to stop . in talking with people on the road ( talking in portuguese , where we had to say everything a few times ) , i was amazed at how afraid everyone was of the indian reservation and the jungle . most said i would not be able to pass through this section of road . i thought that this was just prejudice against the natives . before i entered the reserve , one man told me i would be ‘ killed and eaten ’ by the natives , and then he added something that i did n’t understand and acted out some type of animal with large claws attacking me . i was ready to dismiss what he was saying , but then he said ‘ and , this woman had her husband killed and eaten by the natives . ’ the woman walked over and confirmed what the man had said . at this point i reconsidered traveling slowly on a bike through the reserve . at the reserveâ´s entrance , though , a police officer changed my mind . he told me that such attacks were far in the past , and that they would never happen along the road in the daytime – the tribes would harm only people who enter their reserve where they are not supposed to . ok , i thought , and continued to bike the 75 miles , stopping only to pee and get more food out of my pannier ( i ate while biking ) . the jungle here was thick and alive – i saw numerous monkeys ( scared a few crossing the road ) , a small deer like animal , and heard many sounds that i did not hear elsewhere along the road . on the exit to the reserve , i stopped at a building where some of the indigenous people were selling crarftwork . both of us speaking portuguese , which is neither of our first languages , i learned that yes , these people still hunt with bow and arrows and no , they do not drink any coca-cola ( they did look very healthy ) . i asked about bicycles crossing the reserve , and the man said ‘ it is allowed , but we do not like it . ’ after two more days of travel , mostly through rolling hills , i arrived in the large city of manaus , which sits where the rio negro meets the amazon river . i will be here for a few days before taking a boat up the amazon river and into peru . queretaro to toluca via the butterflies – 5 days 205 miles monday , february 6th , 2006 it is difficult to put recent experiences into an entry here â € “ this trip amazes me every day with new people and experiences , and it is difficult to keep up in the personal journal i write . this blog is a balance between providing interesting stories and not overloading this site â € “ there are many experiences that you do nâ€™t read about . heading south from queretaro , i camped the first night next to the house of a family who grew their own corn , which they eat and feed to their chickens and sheep . the next morning , i watched while the mother of the house and her neighbor hand-made tortillas . they make 500 tortillas five times a week , and you should watch the two videos on the left . the daughter of the house dreams of moving to the u.s. and buying a ford mustang . ( many people in these small towns have worked in the u.s. , and most have family working abroad . ) the land south of queretaro receives more rain than the land to the north , and i traveled south through a patchwork of small corn fields . the harvest was in the fall and the land is mostly bare or covered with dry dead corn stalks . after staying with the bomberos ( firemen ) of the small town of maravatio , i climbed to 11,000 feet where i encountered the first forest i have seen since durango . this is where the butterflies are . hello from la paz , bolivia ! it has been over a year of travel now , and i am excited to write you to officially announce the next phase of ride for climate . announcing ride for climate usa , a bicycle loop around the u.s. to encourage action on global warming . visit the website and see for yourself ! i will be doing this trip with bill bradlee . bill has worked in the non-profit sector fighting global warming for the past decade , and is helping to organize this ride . we will start our trip april 21st in boston , and bicycle west to seattle and then follow the coast south . if we get funding we will return east following a southern route . see our route . ( this route is flexible and may change somewhat . ) please share this new website with friends and family , and especially people who are close to our route . we hope to give many presentations at both schools and community centers ( which will include photos and videos of my current trip ) and we want to encourage people from all over the country to take action on global warming . i am personally very excited for this trip – having traveled latin america , i know that the entire world must take action against global warming and that developing countries will not take the issue seriously unless those of us in the united states take the lead . i beleive that bill and i ( and those of you who help us ) can make a difference and convince people along this route to take action . i will send out my travel update in two more days , complete with the usual photos and stories , so stay tuned and enjoy the thanksgiving weekend ! in bolivia , on mile 11,140 on the way to patagonia , david san diego to ensenada – 3 days , 130 miles monday , december 12th , 2005 after a week of preparation , i left san diego at noon on saturday , riding east through hilly suburbs . i took inland roads to avoid the busy highway along the coast near tiajuana . as night came , i camped off the side of the road so that i could cross the border the next morning . bicycles , it seems , are not stopped when traveling into mexico ( see movie on the left ) , and i felt just a little silly for waiting for a week to get my passport . biking through tecate , i noticed immediately that mexicans use far less gas per person than americans – every car that passed me had at least 3 or more people sitting inside . biking the dry hills south of tecate , i passed through many small and fairly uninhabited valleys before reaching a valley of vineyards near the coast . as dark approached , i asked local residents if there was a place i could pitch my tent . julio quickly invited me to stay at his house , which he shares with his wife , daughter , and parents , and which they built themselves 20 years ago . they spoke no english . my spanish is rapidly improving . the next day was a short ride to ensenada , where i checked the internet to see which school i was going to visit ( from email ) , and then biked to centro educativo patria . afterwards , the prinicipal as well as the partial owner of the school ( they are married ) generously invited me to stay at their ranch . at the ranch , although they only recently purchased a refrigerator and use electricity sparingly , the family lives well . they make their own wine and olive oil , laugh often , and managed to feed a hungry bicyclist extremely well . i am fearful of the number of postcards/thank you cards i will have to send down the road… . san pedro sula to the el salvador border friday , march 31st , 2006 biking from san pedro sula ( hondurasâ€™ northwest corner ) to el salvador i was struck by two things . 1 ) the road was uphill the entire time and 2 ) most of honduras is poor . more so than in the other places i have biked , with perhaps the exception of parts of chiapas , this region felt poor ( see statistics ) . it is not just the people walking the sides of the road – convenience stores were poorly stocked , and it was tough to eat well . many houses are made out of mud bricks ( adobe ) , and the house on the left is on day 4 of 7 of construction . people were friendly , though , and i felt safe and comfortable . i spent one night with a family who lived in a house half made of these bricks . they had no electricity or candles , although they did watch an hour of television every night using a car battery . they were extremely generous , and fed me tortillas that they made from their field of corn ( they had a good amount of land , and enough food ) . i gave them my headlamp , which i hope they are enjoying because it is now much more difficult for me to camp . i visited a primary school , el progreso . i set this visit up by biking by the school and having all the children , who were at recess , run out and stop me , asking what i was doing . thanks to the bomberos ( firemen ) of san pedro sula , who let me stay at their station . they were out fighting fires all night while i slept , and they also gave me a free â€˜bomberos de hondurasâ€™ t-shirt and decal . also , thanks to the the bomberos of santa rosa de copan ( on the right ) , where i stayed two nights later . northern guatemala – climate and maya civilization sunday , march 12th , 2006 gregg , brooks , and i crossed into guatemala from mexico by riding in a small boat across the usumacinta river . although this region is sparsely populated , i noticed an immediate change in the people across the border . the children , instead of asking me how much my bike was worth ( as nearly every person in chiapas asked ) , smiled , played with my bike seat , and tried to say ‘ how are you ’ in english . the police told me no one had been attacked on the road in three years , and i rode the dirt road until i found a small town where locals allowed me to camp . gregg and brooks continued by van , and we split ways . thinly populated , northern guatemala is mostly flat and is covered by thick rainforest except for places cleared for crops or cattle . riding a day and a half , i arrived at the ruins of tikal , a city that was once one of the largest and most important cities of the ancient maya . the mayan civilization thrived from a few centuries before christ until around 900 ad , when the civilization collapsed , and nearly all cities across the peninsula were abandoned . now the impressive stone pyramids and palaces are covered by jungle and tourists . the tikal ruins sit near the large lake of peten-itza , and i stayed in a hotel overlooking this lake for $ 5 a night while nursing a small cold . here i met with a group of researchers who are drilling into the lake ’s bottom , attempting to determine the past climate of the region . by looking at the composition of layers of sediment on the lake ’s bottom , the scientists can determine past rainfall patterns and temperature , as well as the type of vegetation that surrounded the lake . according to their research , around 900ad , when the mayan civilization collapsed , a series of intense droughts struck the region , likely making it difficult for the mayans to feed their large cities . the lake sediments also suggest major deforestation of the region , and it is possible that a combination of drought and land degradation led the mayans to abandon their settlements . we cannot be sure of how the mayan civilization collapsed , but it now seems that climate change helped end one of the greatest ancient civilizations of the new world . bogota , the bicycle , and transportation monday , june 19th , 2006 climbing into the mountains , i reached the high plain were bogota , at 9,000 ft above sea level , sits . bogota is far off my route ( see map ) , and you might be wondering why i chose to bike to the capital of colombia . in the 1990s , in the face of horrible road congestion , bogota did something amazing â € “ it reduced space for cars . the city removed lanes from a number of major thruways to make way for new high-speed busses , and sidewalks that were used for parking cars were replaced by pedestrian walkways and bikeways . a large number of pedestrian bridges were built , allowing people to easily pass over the major roads of the city . in short , the city was redesigned around people instead of around the automobile . i talked with a number of locals about how the city had changed . some cited statistics – whereas traveling across the city used to take a few hours , the new bus system , named the â€˜transmilenioâ€™ will take perhaps 45 minutes . safety has improved as well . not only did traffic accidents reduce significantly , but violent crime also nearly halved ( here is an article about this ) . most people , though , remarked that bogota is simply a nicer place to live and people respect the city more . â€˜people throw less trash in the streetâ€™ , i was told , and â€˜now people are proud to be from bogota.â€™ i stayed for a few days with ricardo ( shown below on the left ) , who runs ciudad humana ( ‘ human city ’ ) , a foundation that promotes improved civil life and transportation in the city . the foundation is a strong supporter of bicycle use in the city , and i spent much time with this group . i helped with a project to fix bicycles in the southern ( poorer ) region of town and also gave presentations to groups of young people who are learning how to be bike mechanics . bogota now has over 300 km of dedicated bike routes in the city , and i biked at least half of them in my week in bogota . according to ricardo , since the installation of the ciclorutas , bicycle use has increased 5 times in the city , and now there are probably between 300,000 and 400,000 trips made daily in bogota by bicycle . a large portion of this use is in the southern , poorer region of town , and i joined ricardo and a few other members of ciudad humana one morning to bike across the city and see the rush hour bike traffic . to be sure , the ciclorutas are not perfect . there are many places in the city where they do not connect , and you may find yourself in the situation of the man shown in the photo on the right . also , they are placed on the sidewalk in such a way so as to put pedestrians and cyclists in competition ( you can watch the video on the right to understand this ) . but the ciclorutas are nonetheless incredibly successful , showing that with more investment , even more is possible . i spent my last day in the city enjoying the ciclovia , an event every sunday where many roads are closed to cars and open only for bicycles . apparently , i saw it on a low turnout day ( blame the world cup – brazil was playing ) , but the roads were still filled with bicycles and people out to enjoy themselves . ( the clowns on the right are in charge of making fun of people without helmets . ) the new bogota has another benefit as well â € “ people are traveling more efficiently , using fewer fossil fuels . indeed , redesigning bogota around people and bicycles has not only improved the safety , health , and pride of its citizens , but the city has also reduced its effect on the global environment . this is a win-win situation â € “ better city living and less carbon dioxide emissions . hopefully , more cities in the world can follow bogota â€™s example . travel update – colombia , venezuela , and brazil thursday , august 24th , 2006 welcome to update 4 from ride for climate ! since last update , i have biked across colombia , venezuela , and northern brazil , traversing the andes , the amazon , and crossing the equator . i crossed the â€˜half-wayâ€™ point of this trip in venezuela , and the trip odometer has passed 9,000 miles . ride for climate continues to reach a wide audience , and since last update , i have visited schools and appeared in newspapers and television in almost every major city i have visited . i write you now from the banks of the amazon river ( map ) . below are entries from the past three months . colombia : 5/28 elections in colombia 6/5 to medellin and into the andes 6/12 medellin to bogota – lots of rain 6/19 bicycles in bogota 6/19 mountaintops and climate change 6/26 bogota to bucaramanga 7/5 bucaramanga to venezuela venezuela : 7/12 is oil good for venezuela ? 7/12 cars and politics in caracas 7/18 floods and climate change 7/26 biking with tom hunt 7/27 coral reefs in venezuela brazil : 8/15 into the amazon and learning portuguese 8/22 the future of the amazon ? best videos : a bombero celebrates his birthday in medellin , colombia bicycle commuters in bogota , colombia a bike is faster than an ambulance in caracas , venezuela truck full of kids yelling ‘ gringo ! gringo ! ’ entering an indigenous reserve in the amazon what does global warming mean for colombia , venezuela , and brazil ? due to rising sea levels , many of the coastal areas i visited , and especially the historic city of cartagena in colombia , are at risk . the water source for bogota , colombia â€™s capital , is also at risk ( see journal entry ) , as the ecosystem that supplies the water sits at the mountain tops and may not survive global warming . this would also undoubtedly cause extinctions . in my journals , i also wrote about floods in caracas as well as potential droughts in the amazon â € “ there is a chance that global warming will cause the amazon to dry out . i also wrote about the coral reefs that i visited off the coast of venezuela â € “ these too are at risk . one topic i have not discussed in my journals , but hope to do so , is the possible spread of tropical diseases . in colombia and venezuela , the majority of the population lives in the mountains , where it is too cold for many tropical diseases such as malaria or dengue . as the climate warms , more of these centers may be exposed to such diseases . check back soon for ride for climate usa i am currently working with people in the u.s. to plan the next phase of ride for climate â € “ a loop around the united states to promote solutions to global warming . i will be sending you all an email shortly about this project and asking for your help , so stay tuned ! do you know people down the road ? over the next few months i will be stopping in the following cities : iquitos , yurimaguas , huaraz , lima , cusco , and la paz , as well as potentially other locations . if you know of people along the way that would be interested in hosting a ride for climate presentation ( or simply help with a place to stay ) , let me know . i am currently taking a boat up the amazon river from manaus into peru . from peru , i will bike across the andes , and then follow the mountain range south crossing peru and bolivia before crossing into argentina and chile , at which point i will send out another update . thank you again to everyone who has helped with this journey , and feel free to send me an email ! best , david miles by country : colombia : 1,123 venezuela : 1,188 brazil : 651
